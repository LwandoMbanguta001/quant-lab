# Topic 2: Introduction to Alternative Investments

## SubTopic 2.4: Quantitative Foundations

### Return and Rate Mathematics

- The Compounding Assumption

Compounding is the recognition of reinvestment of capital, such as interest on interest or, earnings on earnings.

Simple interest is an interest rate computation approach that does not incorporate compounding.

The vast majority of investment reporting and analysis is based on the assumption of compounding.

Returns of short intervals would be adjusted to reflect the compound performance over a full year.

Continuous compounding assumes that earnings can be instantaneously re‐invested to generate additional earnings. 

Discrete compounding includes any compounding interval other than continuous compounding such as daily, monthly, or annual.

- Discrete Compounding

Majority of alternative investments do not assume that earnings can be instantaneously reinvested.

Most alternative investments report performance in discrete time intervals (e.g. weekly, monthly, quarterly) or on a cumulative basis.

Discrete compounding is not commonly used by institutional investors for investments in which there are multiple cash flows (i.e. are using Internal Rate of Return) or for the few securities that price on a continuous compound basis.

Discrete compounding is commonly used for traditional investments (e.g. stocks and bonds) and with open-end fund structures such as hedge funds.

- Continuous Compounding with Logarithmic Returns

Majority of investors use discrete compounding when measuring returns, and a few specific investments priced/valued under the assumption of continuous compounding, most notably derivative contracts.

Let R be total (non‐annualized) return or rate with no compounding. 
Adding 1 to R forms a wealth ratio. 

A log return is a continuously compounded return that can be formed by taking the natural logarithm of a wealth ratio

$$R^{m = \infty} = \ln(1 + R)$$
where:
  
  i) $R^{m = \infty}$ - log return or continuously compounded return.

  ii) $m$ - no. of compounding intervals per year

The advantage of continuous compounding is its ease in aggregating short‐term returns into a longer‐term return.

The mean of a series of log returns has special importance:

$$\text{Arithmetic Mean Log Return} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T R_t^{m = \infty}$$

When the arithmetic mean log return is converted into an equivalent simple rate, that rate is the geometric mean return.

Alternatively, geometric mean returns are computed from the total (non‐annualized) return over an interval as:

$$\text{Geometric Mean Return} = \sqrt[t]{1 + R_{0, T}} - 1$$

Continuous compounding is limited to specific use cases in the practical investment world and is an uncommon tool for many investors. 

Geometric mean return should be used with care in inferring long‐term performance expectations.

### Internal Rate of Return

For such investments, IRR is superior to using traditional performance calculations, however it has numerous potential complications and shortcomings and thus, investors evaluate performance for these investment types across a number of metrics.

IRR is the most common tool used for alternative investments with multiple cash flows (due to using a closed-end fund drawdown structure) and a lack of observable market prices.

Thus investors must understand the mechanics of IRR, the limitations of IRR, and the differences between IRR and traditional time weighted return measurements.

When investors have regular market prices, performance measurement usually computes total return as:

$$\text{Rate of Return} = \frac{\text{change in price (net of fees)} + \text{cash flows recieved (i.e. dividend or interest payments)}}{\text{initial price}}$$

Traditional investment investors favor measuring performance on a compound basis, meaning any interim cash flows received would be reinvested into the investment at prevailing prices. 
Returns measured from one period, can then be linked and compounded with returns from subsequent periods.

- Defining the IRR

Internal rate of return (IRR) is defined as the discount rate that equates the present value of the costs (cash outflows) of an investment with the present value of the benefits (cash inflows) from the investment.

IRR is the discount rate that makes the net present value (NPV) of an investment equal to zero.

Let $\text{CF}_0$ be the cash flow or a valuation related to the start of an investment.
Typically noted as a cash outflow from the investor to the fund.

Then $\text{CF}_1$ - $\text{CF}_{T-1}$ are the actual or projected cash inflows (i.e. flows from the fund to the investor) if positive and cash outflows (i.e. from the investor to the fund) if negative, generated or required by the underlying investment.

Then $\text{CF}_T$ is the final cash flow when the investment terminates, the final cash flow received from selling/disposing of the investment, or a residual valuation, meaning some appraisal of the value of the remaining cash flows related to the investment.

In the case of an appraised valuation of $\text{CF}_T$, the valuation should be designed to represent opinions with regard to the amount of cash that would be received from selling all remaining rights to the investment. 

Thus,
$$\text{CF}_0 + \frac{\text{CF}_1}{(1 + \text{IRR})^1} + \frac{\text{CF}_2}{(1 + \text{IRR})^2} + ... + \frac{\text{CF}_T}{(1 + \text{IRR})^T} = 0$$

- Computing the IRR

  1) For investments that last only a few periods or most of the cash flows are identical (i.e. annuities), the IRR may be solved algebraically with a closed‐form solution.
  
  2) For investments with several different cash flows, the solution relies on a trial‐and‐error search performed by an advanced financial calculator or computer (Goal-Seek).
  
\begin{center}

\end{center}

The IRR is represented by the point at where the NPV curve crosses through the horizontal axis.

\end{center}

- IRR Measurement Intervals

The primary reason for using IRR approach to calculate returns is that illiquidity of the underlying asset prevents observation of highly reliable and regular valuations.

IRR can be calculated across any defined time interval given a series of cash flows. 
These cash flow may be realized (observed), expected (projected), or appraised (e.g. a net asset value)

IRR can be applied to individual investments, or a collection of investments (i.e. held in a private equity fund) in which the cash flows and valuations are pooled together. 

All IRR computations are point‐to‐point computations.

Most investors prefer to measure the since-inception IRR or the IRR in which the time interval begins with the initial cash and ends at a specified date.

The end date may be represented by an interim valuation (here the since-inception IRR is also an interim IRR), or represent the final cash outflow of the investment (i.e. there's no remaining market value and investment has been fully realized). 

An interim IRR is a computation of IRR based on cash flows prior to the investment’s termination and therefore may still be subject to change based on future cash flows and change in market valuations. 

Thus, in interim IRR, $\text{CF}_T$ is an estimated market value rather than a realized cash flow.

\newpage

### Problems with IRR

The first complication arises when an investment offers a complex cash flow pattern other than the traditional pattern of a cash outflow to initiate an investment, followed only by cash inflows until the investment is terminated.

The second complication occurs when investments must be compared to see which is preferred.

- Complex Cash Flow Patterns

A complex cash flow pattern is an investment involving either borrowing or multiple sign changes.

A borrowing type cash flow pattern begins with one or more cash inflows and is followed only by cash outflows.

A multiple sign change cash flow pattern is an investment where the cash flows switch over time from inflows to outflows, or from outflows to inflows, more than once.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=3cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/2.4.3 Im15.png"}
\end{center}

1) In borrowing type cash flow patterns, there is a unique solution (i.e. there is only one IRR that solves the equation), but the IRR must be interpreted differently. 

A high IRR is undesirable because the IRR is revealing the cost of borrowing rather than the return on investment.

When a trial‐and‐error search is performed to find the IRR, any increase in the discount rate lowers the present value of the cash outflows rather than lowering the present value of the cash inflows, as would be the case in a simple cash flow pattern. 

Thus, the trial‐and‐error process must operate in a reverse direction from the simplified investment cash flow pattern.

That is, if the net value with a given discount rate is positive, the next IRR in the search should be lower rather than higher, as occurs in the case of a simplified cash flow pattern.

2) In the case of multiple sign change cash flow patterns, the maximum number of possible IRRs is equal to the number of sign changes. 

There is no easy way for the IRR model to overcome this particular shortcoming.

While each solution is correct and represents a discount rate resulting in an NPV of zero, typically one of the solutions is the most intuitive and is the primary solution. 

For investors unwilling to make this compromise, or scenarios in which no clear solution presents itself, investors may revert to Modified IRR.

- Comparing Investments Based on IRRs

The major challenge with comparing IRRs across investments occurs when investments have scale differences.

Scale differences are when investments have unequal sizes and/or timing of their cash flows.

When comparing investments with different scales, an investment with a higher IRR may be inferior to an investment with a lower IRR.

A common performance debate for investors is comparing an investment with a high IRR and lower multiple of capital against an investment with a lower IRR and a higher multiple of capital.

NB: being offered a larger scale means more money is invested for longer periods of time.

- IRRs Should Not Be Averaged

Aggregation of IRRs refers to the relationship between the IRRs of individual investments and the IRR of the combined cash flows of the investments.

The IRR of a portfolio of two investments is not generally equal to a value‐weighted average of the IRRs of the constituent investments. 

In practice, investors commonly aggregate IRR across investments.

When aggregating multiple investments, those with significant larger (smaller) cash flows will have a greater (lesser) impact on the aggregate IRR.

That is, from separate investments

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=2cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/2.4.3 Im16.png"}
\end{center}

to aggregated investments

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=2cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/2.4.3 Im17.png"}
\end{center}

- IRR and the Reinvestment Rate Assumption

Even if all investments have simplified cash flow patterns without borrowing or multiple sign change problems, the IRR does not necessarily rank investments accurately.
It relies on the reinvestment rate assumption.

The reinvestment rate assumption refers to the assumption of the rate at which any cash flows not invested in a particular investment or received during the investment's life can be reinvested during the investment's lifetime. 

If the assumed reinvestment rate is the same rate of return as the investment's IRR, then no ranking problem exists.

In practice, there'd be no reason to assume that cash inflows could be reinvested at the same rate throughout the project's life, so ranking remains a problem.

\newpage

### Modified Internal Rate of Return

The modified IRR approach addresses the challenges of multiple IRRs and the restrictiveness of the reinvestment assumption in the IRR approach by discounting all project cash outflows into a present value using a user-specified financing rate, compounding all cash inflows into a future value using an assumed reinvestment rate, and calculating the modified IRR as the discount rate that sets the absolute values of that future value and that present value equal to each other.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=5cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/2.4.4 Im18.png"}
\end{center}

Implicit in the use of IRR as a performance measure is the assumption that net distributions can be reinvested at the IRR.

The assumption would be very unrealistic and misleading if IRR were used to rank dissimilar projects.

To address this problem, the modified IRR (MIRR) imposes user‐specified rates to compound all cash inflows forward to the project's termination date and discount all cash outflows back to the project's inception date.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=5cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/2.4.4 Im19.png"}
\end{center}

The modified IRR is calculated as the discount rate that equates the future value of the cash flows to the present value of the negative cash flows (with both signs positive).

$$\text{MIRR}_T = \left(\frac{\text{FV of Positive Cash Flows Using Reinvestment Rate}}{- \text{PV of Negative Cash Flows Using Cost of Capital}} \right)^{\frac{1}{T}} - 1$$
where $T$ - no. of years between project's first and last cash flows.

NB: the negative sign in the denominator highlights the need to use absolute values in place of negative cash flows.

$$\text{MIRR}_T = \left( \frac{\sum_{t=0}^T D_t \times (1 + \text{RR})^{T-t}}{ \lvert \sum_{t=0}^T \frac{C_t}{(1+\text{CC})^t} \rvert} \right)^{\frac{1}{T}} - 1$$

where:

  1) $D_t$ - distribution in year t
  
  2) $C_t$ - contribution in year t
  
  3) $RR$ - expected reinvestment rate for period until time T
  
  4) $CC$ - investors' cost of capital through period T

RR is used to find the total value that the distributions would accrue to at the end of the project's life if they were all reinvested at RR. 

CC is used to find the aggregated initial cost of financing the project's contributions. 

To the extent that RR and CC are accurate and properly reflect implications of the various risks involved, the $\text{MIRR}_T$ can be viewed as an indication of the return earned from the excess of the accrued distributions over the project's financing costs.

- Advantages and Disadvantages of Modified Internal Rate of Return

RR is interpreted as the firm's reinvestment rate, i.e. the expected return the firm could be expected to earn by reinvesting the distributions that it receives from the project.

CC is interpreted as the firm's marginal cost of capital, i.e. the expected cost of financing the project's contributions.

The two advantages to the MIRR approach are that it addresses two important deficiencies with IRR:

  i) By imposing RR and CC for discounting the cash outflows and compounding the cash inflows, the computation of MIRR becomes a simple rate of return computation with no possibility of multiple solutions. 
  
  ii) The MIRR approach overrides the implicit reinvestment assumption of the traditional IRR model (i.e. cash distributions from a project can be reinvested at a rate equal to the project's IRR). 
  When various projects are ranked by IRR, the reinvestment assumption implicit in IRR cause the rankings to differ from those generated by the net present value rule (which is found to be superior). 
  The MIRR approach addresses this problem by imposing a user‐specified reinvestment rate, RR.

The MIRR approach is viewed as having substantial disadvantages that make it a rarely used approach relative to the IRR. 

Unlike IRR; MIRR is driven by user‐selected rates (RR and CC) that conceptually are unrelated to the project.

As the location of the extra rand is moved into the future (i.e. the project's lifetime is expanded with a trivial cash flow), the MIRR approaches the RR because the addition of a distribution even of only R1 causes the approach to compound all of the other distributions to the project's termination.

- Time‐Weighted Returns versus Dollar‐Weighted Returns

Time‐weighted returns are averaged returns that assume that no cash was contributed or withdrawn during the averaging period, meaning after the initial investment.

Dollar‐weighted returns (i.e. money-weighted returns) are averaged returns that are adjusted for and reflect when cash has been contributed or withdrawn during the averaging period. 

The IRR is the primary method of computing a dollar‐weighted return.

When evaluating the return of hedge funds, mutual funds, or any investment, it's important to recognize the distinction between the time‐weighted return (reported on performance charts in marketing literature and client letters), and the dollar‐weighted return, which represents what the average investor actually earned.

Investment managers are best evaluated on time‐weighted returns, as these managers should not be held accountable for the cash flow decisions of their investors. 
Investors should evaluate their own investment results using dollar‐weighted returns based on the cash flows from their particular investment pattern.

\newpage

### Other Performance Measures

In addition to IRR, analysts examine value ratios unadjusted for time value.

- Ratios as Performance Measures

  1) Distribution to paid‐in (DPI) ratio/realized return

is the ratio of the cumulative distribution to investors to the total capital drawn from investors.

Can be loosely viewed as a non‐annualized measure of income (i.e. distributions) in the numerator to total investment in the denominator.

$$\text{DPI}_T = \frac{\sum_{t=0}^T D_t}{\sum_{t=0}^T C_t}$$
where

$D_t$ - distribution in year t

$C_t$ - contribution in year t

This informs investors how much capital has been returned relative to how much capital has been called. 

If $\text{DPI} > 1$, more capital was returned than invested.

If $\text{DPI} < 1$, investors likely continue to have capital at risk and are not assured of permanent capital impairment. 

DPI will remain low early in the life of the investment and will not begin to rise meaningfully until the fund realizes one or more investments.

  2) Residual value to paid‐in (RVPI) ratio/unrealized return

is the ratio of the total value of the unrealized investments at time T to the total capital drawn from investors during the previous time periods.

It reveals how much capital remains at risk relative to the amount of capital invested.

If no distributions have occurred, the RVPI is viewed as a measure of capital gain or loss. 

RVPI is often predicated on knowledge of interim valuations.
When interim valuations are not available, RVPI is the by-product of capital calls (inflows) and distributions ( outflows).

$$\text{RVPI}_T = \frac{\text{NAV}_T}{\sum_{t=0}^T C_t}$$

  3) Total value to paid‐in (TVPI) ratio/Multiple of Invested Capital (MOIC)/Investment Multiple

is a measure of cumulative distributions to investors plus total value of any remaining unrealized investments relative to the total capital drawn from investors, and is the sum of the income (DPI) and capital gain or loss (RVPI)

Absent interim valuations, the RVPI will reflect any known changes in cash flow.

If a fund makes a distribution after the last known valuation, the RVPI will decrease by the size of the distribution, the DPI will increase by the size of the distribution, and the TVPI will remain unchanged.

Investors recognize that change in the TVPI over time is due to gains/losses incurred by the fund and reported via interim market valuations.

TVPI is an alternative measure of total return, revealing overall gains or losses on invested capital. 

When used as an interim measurement:

  - The greater the proportion of the TVPI which comes from DPI, the lower the likelihood of meaningful movement in the TVPI in the future.
  
  - When RVPI represents a larger portion of the TVPI, there remains a significant amount of invested (unrealized) capital and investors may expect meaningful change in the TVPI going forward.

$$\text{TVPI}_T = \frac{ \sum_{t=0}^T D_t + \text{NAV}_T }{ \sum_{t=0}^T C_t}$$
$$= \text{DPI}_T + \text{RVPI}_T$$

NB: these ratios do not take the time value of money into account.

The RVPI and the TVPI depend on net asset values, which in the case of illiquid assets are professional estimates rather than observed market values.

Their estimations are the most problematic components of return evaluation and so DPI (measured using only distributed capital), is seen as being the more reliable measure for mature funds.

When plotting the TVPI across time, investors may note the TVPI can exhibit the J-curve characteristics.

- The Public Market Equivalent (PME) Method & Direct Alpha

While IRR and TVPI do an adequate job of measuring returns, they are not ideal tools for evaluating outperformance.

The most common approach to evaluating relative performance of drawdown style funds is the PME method and the related metric Direct Alpha.

The Public Market Equivalent (PME) method uses a publicly traded securities index that's believed to have a similar risk exposure to the fund as a return target and finds the corresponding premium over the selected index.

PME uses the investment’s cash contributions (calls), distributions, and terminal value in performing the calculation.

The PME method uses the returns of a public market index as a base for the fund’s reinvestment rate and opportunity cost of capital. 

The PME method finds the added (or reduced) cash‐weighted return for a private investment obtained by investing in the private investment rather than by investing in a market index.

The resulting output will look similar to the TVPI in that it is represented as a multiple. 

  i) A multiple of 1.0 implies the private investment generated the exact same returns as the public markets
  
  ii) A multiple greater than 1.0 reveals relative outperformance, and 
  
  iii) A multiple less than 1.0 shows the public markets return exceeded that of the private investment over the same time period. 

Direct Alpha follows a similar pattern, however the calculations use adjusted cash flows to calculate a relative performance IRR where a 0.0% direct alpha indicates an equivalent return.

Application of the PME method involving more than two cash flows requires simulation of the performance of an investment in a public equity market index using the actual cash flows pertaining to an investment in a private fund.

\newpage

### Illiquidity, Accounting Conservatism, IRR, and the J‐Curve

The illiquidity of some alternative investments means that interim IRRs are often based on estimated values rather than market values.

These estimated values are based on accounting principles that reflect the convention of conservativism.

The accounting convention of conservatism holds that it is prudent to recognize potential expenses and liabilities as soon as possible but not to similarly anticipate potential revenues or gains, often resulting in an understatement of income and assets in the short run.

- Accounting Conservatism and Early Fund Losses

In the early years of the private equity fund, the fund’s management team incurs expenses while selecting investments and otherwise managing the fund.

These expenditures are made to build the fund’s long‐run value. 

There is substantial risk that these expenditures will not create value in the long run.

Accounting conservatism dictates that the expenditures should be expensed immediately rather than capitalized as an asset. 

The early losses due to managerial and acquisition expenses tend to generate negative interim IRRs in the early years of funds such as private equity funds.

- Accounting Conservatism and Deferred Recognition of Gains

Another implication of accounting conservatism is to accelerate recognition of losses on investments that are likely to fail and to hold off on fully recognizing potential profits on investments that are progressing nicely. 

Although a few ventures thrive and might be viewed as gaining in value, the prompt recognition of potential losses will tend to generate early losses and deferred net profits. 

The result is that interim IRRs of successful funds may not be positive for five or more years.

Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 157 seeks to require asset managers to regularly value their investments at fair value, even when the valuation is not immediately observable from market prices. 

Rather than holding the investment at cost until an impairment or later round of funding forces a change in valuation, the standard seeks more regular changes in value based on both changes in the fortunes of the company as well as valuations of comparable firms. 

Private equity firms that follow this fair value accounting will likely report company valuations that more accurately predict exit valuations, and have changes in fund NAVs that have higher volatility and higher correlation to liquid financial markets.

- The J‐Curve

is a diagram popular in the analysis of private equity that plots IRR on the vertical axis and time since inception on the horizontal axis, generating the fund performance curve.

The J‐Curve is caused by a combination of early expense recognition, early loss recognition, and deferred gain recognition.
It depicts an apparent decline in value during early years of existence, called valley of tears, before beginning to show the hoped‐for positive returns in the later years of the fund’s life.

Beyond five years, the interim IRRs will give a reasonable indication of the final IRR at the fund’s maturity.

The J‐Curve can also be applied to individual ventures.

Many speculative ventures possess the inherent likelihood of short‐term expenses and long‐term profits that generate the familiar J‐Curve at the venture or company level.

It's the aggregation of the outcomes of individual ventures that forms the fund‐level outcome.

### Distribution of Cash Waterfall

Limited partnerships have provisions for allocation of cash inflows between general partners (GPs) and limited partners (LPs).

Provisions related to the distribution waterfall are the most complex parts of the limited partnership agreement.

The waterfall is a provision of the limited partnership agreement that specifies how distributions from a fund will be split and how the payouts will be prioritized.

The waterfall details what amount must be distributed to the LPs before the fund manager/GPs can take a share from the fund’s profits.

- Cash Waterfalls

Cash inflows to a fund in excess of the costs of investment and the expenses of the fund represent the waterfall that is distributed to GPs and LPs.
Excess revenue above expenses is net cash flow or profit.

In calculating profit, management fees are deducted, but any fees based on profitability are not deducted.

Carried interest is synonymous with an incentive fee/performance‐based fee and is the portion of profit paid to the GPs as compensation for their services, above and beyond management fees.

Carried interest is up to 20% of the profits of the fund and becomes payable once the LPs have achieved repayment of their original investment in the fund, plus any hurdle rate.

A hurdle rate specifies a return level that LPs must receive before GPs begin to receive incentive fees.

When a fund has hurdle rate, the first priority of cash profits is to distribute profits to the LPs until they have received a rate of return equal to the hurdle rate.

The hurdle rate is the return threshold that a fund must return to the fund’s investors, in addition to the repayment of their initial commitment, before the fund manager becomes entitled to incentive fees.

Preferred return, synonymous to hurdle rate, is a return level that LPs must receive before GPs begin to receive incentive fees.

A catch‐up provision permits fund manager to receive a large share of profits once the hurdle rate of return has been achieved and passed. 

A catch‐up provision gives the fund manager a chance to earn incentive fees on all profits, not just the profits in excess of the hurdle rate. 

A catch‐up provision contains a catch‐up rate, which is the percentage of the profits used to catch up the incentive fee once the hurdle is met.
A full catch‐up rate is 100%.

To be effective, the catch‐up rate must exceed the rate of carried interest.

Vesting is the process of granting full ownership of conferred rights, such as incentive fees. 

Rights not yet vested may not be sold or traded by the recipient and may be subject to forfeiture. 

Vesting is a driver of incentives. 

Vesting can be pro rata over the investment period, over the entire term of the fund, or somewhere in between, such as on an annual basis.

A clawback clause, clawback provision, or clawback option is designed to return incentive fees to LPs when early profits are followed by subsequent losses. 

A clawback provision requires the GP to return cash to the LPs to the extent that the GP has received more than the agreed profit split. 

A GP clawback option ensures that if a fund experiences strong performance early in its life and weaker performance at the end, the LPs get back any incentive fees until their capital contributions, expenses, and any preferred return promised in the partnership agreement have been paid.

- The Compensation Scheme

Investors and fund managers have an agency relationship in which investors are the principals and fund managers are their agents.

The compensation scheme is the set of provisions and procedures governing management fees, general partner investment in the fund, carried‐interest allocations, vesting, and distribution.

It is cost‐ineffective to try to maximize the alignment of GP and LP interests.

Management fees are regular fees that are paid from the fund to the fund managers based on the size of the fund rather than on the profitability of the fund.

During the investment period, management fees are calculated as a percentage of the size of the LP commitment, between 1% and 2.5%, depending on fund size.

Management fees may be charged at a lower rate or on the invested NAV of the fund after the investment period concludes or when a successor fund is formed.

General partners have an opportunity to earn a variety of fees from their portfolio companies, including director fees, monitoring fees, transaction fees, restructuring fees, broken deal fees, banking fees, and advisory fees.

Limited partners would prefer that these fees count as management fee offsets, where all fees earned by general partners would reduce the management fee owed to the GP by the LPs.

The general partners’ investment in the fund is the amount of capital they contribute to the fund’s pool of capital.

GPs contribute a meaningful amount of capital to ensure their status as a partner of the fund for income tax reasons.

They contribute substantial personal wealth to the fund to help align the interests of fund managers and their investors. 

Limited partners prefer GPs contribute their investment in cash at the formation of the fund, as GPs earning their commitment through forgone management fees is not an as‐effective alignment of interest.

- Incentive‐Based Fees

Incentive‐based or performance‐based fees are a critical part of the compensation structure.

Carried interest is an incentive‐based fee distributed from a fund to the fund’s manager.

Carried interest is used in private equity and real estate; whilst incentive fee is used in hedge funds.

Management fees are paid regardless of the fund’s performance and therefore fail to provide a powerful incentive to produce exceptional investment results.

Carried interest (i.e. percentage of the profit paid to fund managers) is the most powerful incentive to align interests and create value.

The most common carried‐interest split is 80%/20%, which gives the fund manager a 20% share in the fund’s net profits and is essential to attracting talented and motivated managers. 

These fees are asymmetric, as a fund manager shares in the gains of the investors, but does not compensate investors for any portion of their losses.

- Aggregating Profits and Losses

For multiple projects within private equity funds, two approaches are used for determining profits and distributing incentive fees.
Carried interest can be:

 1) fund‐as‐a‐whole carried interest, which is carried interest based on aggregated profits and losses across all the investments, or
 
 2) dDeal‐by‐deal carried interest, which is when incentive fees awarded separately based on the performance of each individual investment.

Participating in every investment’s profit, or deal‐by‐deal carried interest, can be problematic because the general partner can make profits on successful investments while having little exposure to unsuccessful transactions.
As limited partners take the bulk of the capital risk, this approach significantly weakens the alignment of interests.

A fund‐as‐a‐whole carried‐interest approach protects the interests of the LPs but may be less effective in attracting talented managers.
This scheme may entail the risk of frustrating the fund managers, as their rewards may be deferred for years until all deals can be aggregated.

The amount of the payment is often not as much of an issue as the timing of the payment. 

- Clawbacks and Alternating Profits and Losses

Clawbacks are relevant to funds that calculate carried interest on a fund‐as‐a‐whole basis. 

That is, incentive fees distributed to managers are returned when a firm experiences losses after profits so the total incentive fees paid, ignoring the time value of money, are equal to the incentive fees that would be due if all profits and losses had occurred simultaneously.

An important issue when a fund experiences large gains early in its life, followed by subsequent losses, is whether incentive fees paid on the early profits will be returned to the LPs.

Its possible that incentive fees, or carried interest, could be paid during the earlier profitable stage, even though subsequent losses could cause the investment to have no profit over its entire lifetime.

A limited partner could end up paying incentive fees for an investment that lost money over its lifetime. 
Clawback provisions are designed to address this problem for limited partners.

The goal of clawback provisions is to protect the economic split agreed between the GP and LPs.

Its also called a giveback/lookback, because it requires a partnership to undergo a final accounting of all of its capital and profit distributions at the end of a fund’s lifetime.

Clawback provisions are the opposite of vesting. 
Vesting of fees is the process of making payments available such that they are not subject to being returned.

A clawback provision is a promise to repay overdistributions, but such a promise is only as good as the creditworthiness of the GP. 

The GP is a limited liability vehicle with no assets other than the interest in the fund. 

In the partnership agreements of many funds, the clawback provision binds the GP and requires their cooperation and financial support.

Situations arise in which LPs are unable to receive the clawbacks they are owed. 

Attempting to enforce the clawback provisions may lead to years of litigation without resulting in any return of cash.

The most desirable solution is to ensure that the GP does not receive carried interest until all invested capital has been repaid to investors.

An accepted compromise for securing the clawback obligation is to place a fixed percentage of the fund manager’s carried interest proceeds into an escrow account as a buffer against potential clawback liability.

Clawbacks refer to GP clawbacks, or corrective payments to prevent a windfall to the fund manager.

Its also possible for LPs to receive more than their agreed percentage of carried interest. 

Some partnership agreements also address so‐called LP clawbacks.

- Hard Hurdle Rates

A hurdle rate/preferred return specifies that a fund manager cannot receive a share in the distributions until the limited partners have received aggregate distributions equal to the sum of their capital contributions as well as a specified return (i.e. hurdle rate). 

A hurdle rate specifies a return level that LPs must receive before GPs begin to receive incentive fees.

A hard hurdle rate limits incentive fees to profits in excess of the hurdle rate.

The sequence of cash distributions with a hard hurdle rate:

  1) Capital is returned to limited partners until their investment has been repaid
  
  2) Profits are distributed only to limited partners until hurdle rate is reached
  
  3) Additional profits are split such that fund manager receives an incentive fee only on profits in excess of hurdle rate

- Soft Hurdles and a Catch‐Up Provision

A soft hurdle rate allows fund managers to earn an incentive fee on all profits, given the hurdle rate has been achieved.

The soft hurdle allows fund manager to receive incentive fee on the entire profit. 

A soft hurdle has catch‐up provision that can be viewed as providing the fund manager with a disproportionate share of excess profits until the manager has received the incentive fee on all profits.

The sequence of cash distributions with a soft hurdle rate:

  1) Capital is returned to limited partners until their investment has been repaid
  
  2) Profits are distributed only to limited partners until hurdle rate is reached
  
  3) Additional profits are split, with a high proportion going to the fund manager until the fund manager receives an incentive fee on all of the profits.

Once the fund manager has been paid an incentive fee on all previous profits, additional profits are split using the incentive fee (i.e. catch‐up provision).

- Incentive Fee as an Option

Incentive fees are long call options to GPs,i.e. receive payout of a call option.

The underlying asset is the fund’s net asset value, and the time to expiration of the option is the time until the next incentive fee is calculated, at which time a new option is written for the next incentive fee. 

In the absence of a hurdle rate, the strike price of the call option is the net asset value of the fund at the start of the period or the end of the last period in which an incentive fee was paid, whichever is greater.

The GPs pay for this call option by providing their management expertise.

A hurdle rate is increasing the strike price of the incentive fee call option. 

A hurdle rate increases the amount by which the net asset value of the fund must rise before the fund manager receives an incentive fee. 

The higher the hurdle rate, the lower the value of the call option.

The call option moves in‐the‐money when the net asset value of a fund rises to the point of providing a return in excess of any hurdle rate.

The call option moves out‐of‐the‐money when the net asset value of the fund falls below the point of providing a return in excess of any hurdle rate.

When the option is below or near its strike price, incentive fees provide the fund manager with an incentive to increase the risk of the fund’s assets. 

The effect of increased risk is to increase the value of the call option. 

If the risks generate profits, the fund manager can benefit through high incentive fees. 

If the risks generate losses, the effect on the fund manager is limited to receiving no incentive fee, ignoring clawbacks

When incentive fee call option is deep‐in‐the‐money, the fund manager benefits less from an increase in the risk of the underlying assets.

The consequences of net asset value changes to the fund manager are more symmetrical when the option is deep‐in‐the‐money, meaning large incentive fees are likely.

Risk aversion may motivate the fund manager to lessen the risk of the underlying assets when the incentive fee option is deep‐in‐the‐money.

Multifaceted incentives generated by the option-like character of incentive fees are perverse. 

The LPs prefer fund managers to take risks based on market opportunities and the risk‐return preferences of the LPs. 

Incentive fees can motivate fund managers to base investment decisions on the resulting risks to their personal finances. 

Thus, incentive fees can cause decisions involving risk to be based on the degree to which an option is in‐the‐money, near‐the‐money, or out‐of‐the‐money.

### Returns Based on Notional Principal

Rate of return is defined as the rate at which an asset changes value (with any interim cash flows, such as dividends, considered).

- The Challenge of Returns on Positions with Zero Value

A forward contract is defined as an agreement to make an exchange at some date in the future, known as the delivery date.

Forward contracts can be viewed as starting with a value of zero because the initial value of the item to be delivered is usually equal to the value of the item to be received. 

As soon as time begins to pass, the value of the contract would become positive to one side of the contract and negative to the other side of the contract. 

The traditional formula for the return without any interim cash flows:

$$\text{Return} = \frac{ \text{Ending Value} - \text{Starting Value} }{ \text{Starting Value} }$$

- Notional Principal and Full Collateralization

One solution to the problem of computing return for derivatives is to base the return on notional principal.

The return on notional principal divides economic gain or loss by the notional principal of the contract. 

Notional principal or notional value of a contract is the value of the asset underlying, or used as a reference to, the contract or derivative position. 

#### Example 1

Assuming the hedge fund reports its performance in euros and the change in the yen–euro exchange rate caused a loss to the fund of 1,000 euros.
Selecting 1 million euros as the notional principal:

$$\text{Change in Value} = \frac{ - 1000 \text{ euros} }{ 1000000 \text{ euros} } = -0.10 \text{%}$$

This has little economic importance for the hedge fund, since it has not invested any capital into the contract. 

A percentage loss is interpreted as being based on the amount of capital invested.

The problem of calculating rate of return when there is no initial investment is identical to the problem of calculating the rate of return on a fully leveraged position, such as when a position in a risky asset is fully financed through borrowing.

To provide greater economic meaning, the return is expressed on a fully collateralized basis. 

Fully collateralized means that a position is assumed to be paired with a quantity of capital equal in value to the notional principal of the contract. 

A fully collateralized position has equivalent risk and return to a long position in the underlying asset using the cash or spot market.

A fully collateralized position has two components of return:

  1) The change in the value of the derivative, and
  
  2) Any return on the collateral

Its assumed that the investor is able to receive a short‐term interest rate, such as riskless rate on the collateral.
Let:

 R - percentage change in the value of the derivative based on notional value and using continuous compounding (i.e. log returns)
 
 $R_{fcoll}$ - the return on a fully collateralized position

$$R_{fcoll} = \ln(1 + R) + R_f$$
where

  $R$ - the change in the derivatives price divided by its previous price or notional value

The first term is the continuously compounded percentage change in the fully collateralized position due to changes in the value of the derivative. 

The second term is the percentage change in the fully collateralized position from interest on the collateral. 

The sum represents the total return on the fully collateralized position. 

All three are expressed as continuously compounded rates (log returns) and are based on one period, such as a year.

- Partially Collateralized Rates of Return

The concept of full collateralization is hypothetical; the party to the derivative has not actually set aside the full collateral amount in a dedicated account.

In practice, parties to a derivative position are often required to deposit specified levels of funds to partially collateralize the position. 

A partially collateralized position has collateral lower in value than the notional value.

Suppose that the notional principal of a derivative contract is $\lambda$ times the quantity of collateral required (i.e. amount of collateral required is $\frac{1}{\lambda} \times$ the notional principal). 

There would be a requirement of posting one unit of cash collateral for every $\lambda$ units of notional principal.

The formula for the log return of a partially collateralized position, $R_{pcoll}$, reflects the same change in the derivative contract, $R$, but must be adjusted to reflect the reduced denominator (starting value) due to reduced required collateral (i.e., use of leverage). 

The amount of interest received on the collateral declines but remains constant as a percentage of the collateral:

$$R_{pcoll} = [ \lambda \times \ln(1+R)] + R_f$$

The use of leverage magnifies the effect of changes in the derivative as a percentage of the money invested.
