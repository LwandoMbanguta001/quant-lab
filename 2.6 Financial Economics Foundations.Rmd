### Informational Market Efficiency

Informational market efficiency refers to the extent to which asset prices reflect available information.

An informationally efficient market is a market in which assets are traded at prices that equal their values based on all available information. 

The concept of informational market efficiency is referred to as efficient market theory or efficient market hypothesis.

All financial markets display some informational market efficiency, but no financial market is perfectly efficient.

- Further Definitions of Informational Market Efficiency

Informationally efficient markets are described as markets in which net present values (NPVs) of all investment decisions are zero.

Informationally efficient markets are described as markets in which investors are unable to use information to consistently earn superior risk‐adjusted returns.

Investors bearing higher risk should earn consistently higher returns, and any investor bearing risk might occasionally earn high returns.

However, in informationally efficient market, investors cannot earn higher expected returns without bearing additional risk. 

- Forms or Levels of Informational Market Efficiency

  i) Weak form informational market efficiency (or weak level)

refers to market prices reflecting available data on past prices and volumes (i.e. historical trading data).

It addresses the issue of whether technical analysis can be useful in earning consistent and superior risk‐adjusted returns.

  ii) Semi-strong form informational market efficiency (or semi-strong level)

refers to market prices reflecting all publicly available information (incl. not only past prices and volumes but also any publicly available information such as financial statements and other underlying economic data).

It's designed to address the issue of whether technical and fundamental analysis can be useful in earning consistent and superior risk‐adjusted returns.

  iii) Strong form informational market efficiency (or strong level) 

refers to market prices reflecting all publicly and privately available information. 

It's designed to address the issue of whether any attempts to earn consistent and superior risk‐adjusted returns can be successful, incl. insider trading.

The only thing that changes between the three levels or forms is the information set.

The information sets moving from weak form to semi-strong form to strong form are cumulative. 
Thus, if weak form efficiency is violated, then all three forms will be violated, but violation of strong form efficiency does not imply violation of the weak or semi-strong forms.

- Informational Market Efficiency and "Efficient Inefficiency"

In an informationally efficient market, the stock price reflects all potential cash flows (with their attendant probabilities), the moment the information regarding those cash flows is revealed to the marketplace.

In such a market, no investor is able to consistently earn superior risk‐adjusted returns based on available information, because the information is instantaneously reflected in market prices when it becomes publicly available.

Informational market efficiency is a theoretical idea rather than a precise description of actual markets. 

Perfect market efficiency is how financial analysts predict how prices should behave, allowing traders to identify mispriced assets and estimate their expected return and risk.

Markets tend to be more informationally efficient to the extent that they:

  i) are being traded by large numbers of well‐informed and financially sound traders competing for profits
  
  ii) contain securities for which substantial amounts of reliable information are made broadly and quickly available
  
  iii) are subject to minimal transactions costs, taxes, and other impediments to trade
  
The proposition that markets are perfectly efficient is inconsistent with rational investing, as no trader could earn a superior profit by performing analyses using available information.

In the long run, the existence of market inefficiencies incentivizes analysts to use available information to drive markets toward efficiency.

The enigma as to how markets can become efficient when efficiency destroys the incentives to process information has led to the proposition that markets tend toward being efficiently inefficient.

The empirical and theoretical evidence together suggest that skill‐based trading strategies are more likely to be successful when:

  i) executed by the most skilled traders in any market and 
  
  ii) executed in relatively new markets or with relatively new securities that have less competition among skill‐based traders

- Factors Driving Informational Market Efficiency

The underlying factors that cause the competition or analysis to drive prices toward informationally efficient levels:

  1) Market Value - the greater the value of the assets being traded, the greater the competition for potential profits and losses from mispricing, within limits.
  
  2) Trading Frequency - greater trading frequency for the assets increases competition by providing greater incentives for investors, speculators, and arbitrageurs to analyze information and attempt to make favorable trades. 
  Securities traded very infrequently have large bid‐ask spreads due to reduced profit potential for traders to benefit from mispricing.
  
  3) Trading Frictions - low levels of trading frictions facilitate higher competition by encouraging arbitrage and speculation with lowering of total trading costs. 
  Reduced trading frictions incl lower transaction costs, such as brokerage fees, exchange fees, regulatory fees, and taxes.
  
  4) Regulatory Constraints - fewer regulatory constraints on trading also tend to lead to improved informational market efficiency by expanding competition and trading.
  
  5) Ease of Access to Information - assets tend to trade at prices closer to their informationally efficient values when there is easier access to better information, as better information facilitates better financial analysis.
  
  6) Valuation Certainty - assets trade at prices closer to their informationally efficient values when there is less uncertainty about their valuation. 
  That is, better valuation methods lead to better analysis.

- Factors Influencing Informational Efficiency in Alternative Asset Markets

It's primarily with regard to the fifth and sixth factors that many alternative markets possess features that lend themselves to less efficient pricing: substantial non-public information and substantial uncertainty with regard to valuation methods.

The complex trading strategies inherent in some alternative investments rely on the discovery and exploitation of market inefficiencies in order to be successful. 

Market efficiency (or lack thereof) plays a major role in the quality and source of returns for investors.

Less efficient markets provide investors with more opportunity for excess return whether it be from mispriced risk premia or true alpha.

### The Time Value of Money, Prices, and Rates

- Zero‐Coupon Bond Prices and the Time Value of Money

Consider a set of default‐free zero‐coupon bonds with R1 face values (principal amounts) and with various maturities or longevities. 

In a perfect market with positive time value to money, a plot of the prices of these zero‐coupon bonds against their longevities forms a monotonically declining function that asymptotically approaches zero as the longevities approach infinity.

This is the present value function.

\begin{center}

\end{center}

Most applications in finance express time value of money through lens of interest rates. 

Interest rates are used to enable improved intuition, yet they introduce substantial complexities due to issues such as compounding intervals.

- Deriving Interest Rates from Zero‐Coupon Bond Prices

Let $r_t^{m=1}$ be interest rate corresponding to default‐free cash flows due in $t$ years, calculated in annual compounding (i.e. $m = 1$).

The rate is calculated from the formula for a zero‐coupon bond price based on annual compounding of interest:
$$B(t) = FV \left( 1 + r_t^{m=1} \right)^{-t}$$

where $FV$ is the face value or principal amount of the bond.

More generally, for any finite compounding assumption with $r^m_t$ as annual rate to be compounded $m$ times per year:

$$B(t) = FV \left( 1 + \frac{r^m_t}{m} \right)^{-tm}$$

$$r^m_t = \left( \left( \frac{B(t)}{FV} \right)^{- \frac{1}{mt}} - 1 \right) \times m$$

Semi-annual compounding is the most common convention in bond market quotations.

- Determination of the Short‐Term Interest Rate

Although markets price intraday lending, especially at times of crisis, the short‐term interest rate generally refers to holding periods of one day, one week, or perhaps even one month. 

To the extent that a market is informationally efficient, the expected rate of return on various assets should be viewed on a real or after‐inflation basis.

The level of anticipated inflation is incorporated into any nominal rate of the time value of money. 

A nominal interest rate is the rate of return measured in terms of a given currency without a downward adjustment for the potential effects of positive inflation. 

Inflation is the rate of change in the value of a currency relative to a basket of real assets with a positive inflation rate indicating that the value of the currency is declining. 

The anticipated inflation rate ($\pi$) is defined as a measure of the expected rate of change in the value of a currency measured through changes in overall price levels.

The Fisher effect (or Fisher equation) states that the nominal interest rate (i) is equal to the sum of real interest rate (r) and the expected inflation rate ($\pi$), when interest rates are expressed as continuously compounded rates. 

The real interest rate is annualized rate earned on default‐free fixed‐income investments, after adjusting the nominal rate downward for the effect of inflation.

The traditional Fisher equation is modified for anticipated income taxes by assuming a uniform tax rate (T) on nominal interest income. 

The modified Fisher equation expresses the nominal interest rate (i) as the combination of the real interest rate, r, and the anticipated rate of inflation ($\pi$), with an adjustment for the income tax rate, T

$$i = r + \frac{\pi}{1 - T}$$

Here, r, i and $\pi$ are continuously compounded rates. 

The Fisher equation is equal to the modified Fisher equation for the case of T = 0.

A nominal price is the stated price of an asset measured using the contemporaneous values of a currency.

A real price is the price of an asset that is adjusted for inflation through being expressed in the value of currency from a different time period. 

- Estimating the Term Structure of Interest Rates with Zero‐Coupon Bonds

The term structure of interest rates is the relationship between spot interest rates and their associated longevities (i.e. times‐to‐maturity).

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=5cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/2.6.2 Im28.png"}
\end{center}

The yield to maturity of a fixed‐income instrument is the rate that discounts all the promised cash flows of the instrument into a summed present value that equals the instrument's market price

- The Yield Curve and Its Approximation

Fixed‐income analysts use coupon bonds to estimate most/all of the maturity ranges of the term structure of interest rates, because zero‐coupon bonds are not available for longer maturities. 

A coupon bond with annual coupon of C is priced:

$$P_0 = \sum^T_{t=1} \frac{C}{(1+y)^t} + \frac{FV}{(1+y)^T}$$

The bond's yield to maturity (or simply yield), y, is the rate that solves the above equation.

A yield to maturity discounts each cash flow at same rate regardless of its longevity and, is formed as a mixture of spot rates associated with each cash flow.

Each cash flow should be discounted with a rate associated with its longevity.

However, yields are often used as a proxy for the term structure.

Yields‐to‐maturity are plotted against their corresponding terms‐to‐maturity and are described as yield curves that resemble the term structure of spot interest rates.

For zero‐coupon bonds, the yield to maturity and implied spot rate are identical because the zero‐coupon bond has only one cash flow.

### Forward Interest Rates

- Implied Forward Rates

#### Example 1

Consider 1-year zero-coupon bond with face value of R100 and market value of R90.
If investor holds the bond to maturity, the return over the next year will be 11.11%.

Investor is contemplating selling 1-year bond immediately, and rolling proceeds into a 2-year R100 face value zero-coupon bond with market value of R80 per R100 of face value (offering yield based on annual compounding of 11.8034%).

If investor rolled over the full sales price (R90) into 2-year zero-coupon bond, the principal amount/face value is purchased at R112.50 (i.e. $\frac{R90}{R80} \times R100$).
The incremental cash flows of moving from 1-year bond to 2-year bond are below:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=3cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/2.6.3 Im29.png"}
\end{center}

=>

The return on incremental cash flows between year 1 and 2:
$$\frac{R112.50 - R100}{R100} = 12.50 \%$$

i.e. incremental cash flows indicate that the investor has R100 less in one year and R112.50 more in two years by exchanging the one‐year bond for the two‐year bond. 

12.50% is implied return of investing between periods 1 and 2 in the 2‐year bond, known as an implied forward rate.

An implied forward rate, $F(t, T)$, is the annual return between time t and T, inferred from the term structure of interest rates.

- Implied Forward Rates with Annual Compounding

Consider an investor weighing two choices:

  i) Invest for T years at $r_T$, or
  
  ii) Invest for a shorter period (t) at rate $r_t$ and then reinvest proceeds into a forward rate, $F(t, T)$ for the remaining $T-t$ years.

In the absence of default risk, these alternatives generate identical returns in a perfect market since they each generate riskless proceeds in T years

Setting future values of R1 in T years from both alternatives equals:
$$(1 + r_T)^T = (1+r_t)^t \times \left( 1 + F(t, T) \right)^{T-t}$$

Thus, solving for $F(t, T)$:

$$F(t, T) = \left( \frac{(1+r_T)^T}{(1+r_t)^t} \right)^{\frac{1}{T-t}}- 1$$

- The Term Structure of Implied Forward Rates

The two most common choices with which to plot a term structure of forward rates are one year ($T - t = 1$) and infinitesimal (when $T - t \rightarrow 0$).

A common structure in interest rate analysis is the term structure of implied forward rates.

The term structure of implied forward rates is the relationship between implied forward rates and starting point of each rate and is often superimposed on the term structure of spot rates. 

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=5cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/2.6.3 Im30.png"}
\end{center}

Given the relation for spot and forward rates, it's clear that the forward rate will lie above (below) the spot rate in the case of an upward (downward) sloping spot rate. 

The gap between the two tends to diminish from left to right. 

The forward rate tends to "exaggerate" slope changes in the spot rate because the spot is an averaged rate while the forward rate is a marginal rate.
