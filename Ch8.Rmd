# Ch8: Managing Bond Portfolios

### Introduction

Bond market investments are an important asset class because they offer diversification, stability and superior returns at times. 

Traditionally, bond investments are the second largest asset category of institutional investors after equities.

There are a variety of bonds available in the mature bond markets, such as variable rate bonds, zero-coupon bonds, inflation-linked bonds, fixed rate bonds with embedded options, and “plain vanilla” bond (pays a fixed coupon once or twice a year in arrears and has a fixed maturity date).

The management of a bond portfolio in terms of strategy is categorised as active or passive, and there are hybrids of the two strategies:

  i) Passive
  
  ii) Active
  
  iii) Hybrids of active and passive

### Passive Bond Portfolio Strategies

  1) Buy and Hold Strategy
  
Involves the selection of a bond with the desired characteristics and holding the bond to maturity. 

With a buy-and-hold strategy, the investor does not care about the current market price of the bond being held. 

Such an investor is committed to receiving the par value at maturity of the bond.

As such, they do not consider price risk.

  2) Index-tracking strategy

Tracking an index involves the selection of the index, and purchasing the constituents of the index in the relevant proportions, and holding them for the investment horizon period.

This is called full-replication and not often implemented because:

i) it involves purchase of many bonds.

ii) When constituents of index are changed, much buying and selling is involved, which can be costly.

iii) Its not always possible to make up the constituents of the index at fair value prices, i.e. some parts of bond market can be mispriced and/or illiquid at time of purchase/sale.

There are 3 alternatives to full-replication of chosen index:

i) Purchase a sample of bonds which represent the index, i.e. sampling.

ii) Buy relevant futures/options contracts (as futures and options generally closely track the value of underlying assets).
Bond indices have futures and/or options contracts written on them.

iii) Buy into a relevant ETF. 
An all-bond index ETF will be invested in the constituents of the index, thus tracks the index on behalf of investors in the ETF.

  3) Immunisation strategy
  
Immunisation is used when there are future liabilities that need to be paid from the bond assets.

An immunisation strategy means the elimination of interest rate risk. 

It's one of the most used strategies, particularly by long-term insurers and retirement funds.

Market risk is the risk of the price of a fixed rate bond falling as a result of market rate on it increasing.

Interest rate risk applies to financial intermediaries, i.e. those institutions which have financial liabilities and assets which are repriced at different times.

E.g. a bank with R100 billion floating rate liabilities and R100 billion floating rate assets which mature in the same time bucket has no interest rate risk. 

If it has R100 billion floating rate liabilities and the same amount of 10-year fixed rate bonds as assets, it has major interest rate risk (this portfolio reflects an interest rate view – rates are about to fall – which may not materialise).

Characteristics of bonds in terms of market risk are:

i) Bond prices rise when interest rates (i.e. yields to maturity (YTM)) that apply to them fall.

ii) Bond prices fall when rates increase.

iii) Rate increases bring about proportionately smaller price changes than rate decreases of the same magnitude.

iv) The maturity of a bond has a major effect on price sensitivity, i.e. the longer the bond, the more price-sensitive it is to changes in interest rates.

v) Market risk is inversely proportional to coupon rate, i.e. prices of higher coupon bonds are less sensitive to changes in interest rates than the prices of lower coupon bonds.

The 3 key factors that influence the sensitivity of a bond’s price to changes in market rates are: 

i) market rate

ii) coupon rate and 

iii) term to maturity. 

These factors led to the search for a different measure of maturity, i.e. the effective maturity of a bond, a common measure for interest rate sensitivity.
Hence Macaulay Duration.

Thus, a fixed rate bond has the same price risk (interest rate sensitivity) as another fixed rate bond that has the same duration, and both these have the same price risk as a zero-coupon bond with a maturity equal to the duration of the fixed rate bonds.

Pursuing an immunisation strategy involves the insulation of a portfolio from interest rates risk.

Banks have liabilities and assets that are mismatched in terms of repricing date(s).

They are therefore exposed to interest rate risk.

For this reason, banks endeavour to manage the gap, called gap management.

They do this by matching the repricing periods of assets with the repricing periods of liabilities (variable rate overdrafts matched by variable rate deposits is an example).

Banks have it relatively easy compared with retirement funds and insurers, which have long-term liabilities/obligations. 

E.g. an insurer has issued a guaranteed investment product in the form of a 10-year annuity with fixed annual payments: has a fixed-rate liability.

The issue of the product/liability brings in short-term funds (initially placed on deposit). 

It thus has interest rate risk. 

The strategy is to immunise the portfolio by removing interest rate risk.

Purchasing a fixed-rate bond of appropriate size that has annual payments and a duration that matches the duration of the liability accomplishes this.

A risk inherent in this strategy (if coupon inflows do not match the annual payments on the investment product issued) is reinvestment risk, but the risk is small. 

If rates fall, the coupons will earn less over the remaining period, but a capital profit will be made on the bond when sold.

Conversely, if rates rise a capital loss will be encountered, but this will be compensated for by higher earnings on the coupon. 

A cash matching technique is the one where a liability is exactly matched with the asset. 

E.g. for a 10-year annuity with a balloon payment at maturity, a perfect match is a zero coupon bond that matures on the same day. 

Where the annuity has annual payments, the solution is to purchase a series of zero coupon bonds that match the payments.

However, cash flow matching is not always possible, because many obligations have multi-period payments.

The solution is to match the multi-period payments with a series of bonds that have durations that match the payments, which is called a dedication strategy. 

Where this is not possible, the portfolio manager has to get as close as possible to matching the duration of the assets to the duration of the liabilities.

### Active Bond Portfolio Strategies

  1) Interest rate anticipation strategies
  
Interest rate anticipation strategies involve the undertaking of economic analyses, and the taking of positions in bonds based on anticipated interest rate movements. 

These strategies involve market risk, which is correlated with term to maturity and coupon.

Economic analysis involves myriad factors and scenarios, with the outcome the future course of interest rates, both short-term and long-term, i.e. the future shape of yield curve. 

The following are analysed:

i) International economy

ii) Domestic real economy

iii) Short-term economic indicators

iv) Balance of payments

v) Public finance developments, especially budget deficit and supply of government securities.

vi) Monetary developments - growth in money stock and its sources, and monetary policy actions of central bank which has a direct influence on the bottom end of the yield curve and on the demand for bank loans (which is major source of change in money stock).

vii) Price developments (inflation)

All these factors are interrelated, and subjective assessments have to be made to arrive at the future level and shape of yield curve. 

Based on economic forecast, various techniques are employed:

  a) Outright positions
  
  
  
  b) Rate anticipation swap
  
  c) Interest rate swaps
  
  d) Horizon analysis
  
  e) Futures and options
