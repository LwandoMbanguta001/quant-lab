## SubTopic 2.6: Financial Economics Foundations

### Informational Market Efficiency

Informational market efficiency refers to the extent to which asset prices reflect available information.

An informationally efficient market is a market in which assets are traded at prices that equal their values based on all available information. 

The concept of informational market efficiency is referred to as efficient market theory or efficient market hypothesis.

All financial markets display some informational market efficiency, but no financial market is perfectly efficient.

- Further Definitions of Informational Market Efficiency

Informationally efficient markets are described as markets in which net present values (NPVs) of all investment decisions are zero.

Informationally efficient markets are described as markets in which investors are unable to use information to consistently earn superior risk‐adjusted returns.

Investors bearing higher risk should earn consistently higher returns, and any investor bearing risk might occasionally earn high returns.

However, in informationally efficient market, investors cannot earn higher expected returns without bearing additional risk. 

- Forms or Levels of Informational Market Efficiency

  i) Weak form informational market efficiency (or weak level)

refers to market prices reflecting available data on past prices and volumes (i.e. historical trading data).

It addresses the issue of whether technical analysis can be useful in earning consistent and superior risk‐adjusted returns.

  ii) Semi-strong form informational market efficiency (or semi-strong level)

refers to market prices reflecting all publicly available information (incl. not only past prices and volumes but also any publicly available information such as financial statements and other underlying economic data).

It's designed to address the issue of whether technical and fundamental analysis can be useful in earning consistent and superior risk‐adjusted returns.

  iii) Strong form informational market efficiency (or strong level) 

refers to market prices reflecting all publicly and privately available information. 

It's designed to address the issue of whether any attempts to earn consistent and superior risk‐adjusted returns can be successful, incl. insider trading.

The only thing that changes between the three levels or forms is the information set.

The information sets moving from weak form to semi-strong form to strong form are cumulative. 
Thus, if weak form efficiency is violated, then all three forms will be violated, but violation of strong form efficiency does not imply violation of the weak or semi-strong forms.

- Informational Market Efficiency and "Efficient Inefficiency"

In an informationally efficient market, the stock price reflects all potential cash flows (with their attendant probabilities), the moment the information regarding those cash flows is revealed to the marketplace.

In such a market, no investor is able to consistently earn superior risk‐adjusted returns based on available information, because the information is instantaneously reflected in market prices when it becomes publicly available.

Informational market efficiency is a theoretical idea rather than a precise description of actual markets. 

Perfect market efficiency is how financial analysts predict how prices should behave, allowing traders to identify mispriced assets and estimate their expected return and risk.

Markets tend to be more informationally efficient to the extent that they:

  i) are being traded by large numbers of well‐informed and financially sound traders competing for profits
  
  ii) contain securities for which substantial amounts of reliable information are made broadly and quickly available
  
  iii) are subject to minimal transactions costs, taxes, and other impediments to trade
  
The proposition that markets are perfectly efficient is inconsistent with rational investing, as no trader could earn a superior profit by performing analyses using available information.

In the long run, the existence of market inefficiencies incentivizes analysts to use available information to drive markets toward efficiency.

The enigma as to how markets can become efficient when efficiency destroys the incentives to process information has led to the proposition that markets tend toward being efficiently inefficient.

The empirical and theoretical evidence together suggest that skill‐based trading strategies are more likely to be successful when:

  i) executed by the most skilled traders in any market and 
  
  ii) executed in relatively new markets or with relatively new securities that have less competition among skill‐based traders

- Factors Driving Informational Market Efficiency

The underlying factors that cause the competition or analysis to drive prices toward informationally efficient levels:

  1) Market Value - the greater the value of the assets being traded, the greater the competition for potential profits and losses from mispricing, within limits.
  
  2) Trading Frequency - greater trading frequency for the assets increases competition by providing greater incentives for investors, speculators, and arbitrageurs to analyze information and attempt to make favorable trades. 
  Securities traded very infrequently have large bid‐ask spreads due to reduced profit potential for traders to benefit from mispricing.
  
  3) Trading Frictions - low levels of trading frictions facilitate higher competition by encouraging arbitrage and speculation with lowering of total trading costs. 
  Reduced trading frictions incl lower transaction costs, such as brokerage fees, exchange fees, regulatory fees, and taxes.
  
  4) Regulatory Constraints - fewer regulatory constraints on trading also tend to lead to improved informational market efficiency by expanding competition and trading.
  
  5) Ease of Access to Information - assets tend to trade at prices closer to their informationally efficient values when there is easier access to better information, as better information facilitates better financial analysis.
  
  6) Valuation Certainty - assets trade at prices closer to their informationally efficient values when there is less uncertainty about their valuation. 
  That is, better valuation methods lead to better analysis.

- Factors Influencing Informational Efficiency in Alternative Asset Markets

It's primarily with regard to the fifth and sixth factors that many alternative markets possess features that lend themselves to less efficient pricing: substantial non-public information and substantial uncertainty with regard to valuation methods.

The complex trading strategies inherent in some alternative investments rely on the discovery and exploitation of market inefficiencies in order to be successful. 

Market efficiency (or lack thereof) plays a major role in the quality and source of returns for investors.

Less efficient markets provide investors with more opportunity for excess return whether it be from mispriced risk premia or true alpha.

### The Time Value of Money, Prices, and Rates

- Zero‐Coupon Bond Prices and the Time Value of Money

Consider a set of default‐free zero‐coupon bonds with R1 face values (principal amounts) and with various maturities or longevities. 

In a perfect market with positive time value to money, a plot of the prices of these zero‐coupon bonds against their longevities forms a monotonically declining function that asymptotically approaches zero as the longevities approach infinity.

This is the present value function.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=5cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/2.6.2 Im27.png"}
\end{center}

Most applications in finance express time value of money through lens of interest rates. 

Interest rates are used to enable improved intuition, yet they introduce substantial complexities due to issues such as compounding intervals.

- Deriving Interest Rates from Zero‐Coupon Bond Prices

Let $r_t^{m=1}$ be interest rate corresponding to default‐free cash flows due in $t$ years, calculated in annual compounding (i.e. $m = 1$).

The rate is calculated from the formula for a zero‐coupon bond price based on annual compounding of interest:
$$B(t) = FV \left( 1 + r_t^{m=1} \right)^{-t}$$

where $FV$ is the face value or principal amount of the bond.

More generally, for any finite compounding assumption with $r^m_t$ as annual rate to be compounded $m$ times per year:

$$B(t) = FV \left( 1 + \frac{r^m_t}{m} \right)^{-tm}$$

$$r^m_t = \left( \left( \frac{B(t)}{FV} \right)^{- \frac{1}{mt}} - 1 \right) \times m$$

Semi-annual compounding is the most common convention in bond market quotations.

- Determination of the Short‐Term Interest Rate

Although markets price intraday lending, especially at times of crisis, the short‐term interest rate generally refers to holding periods of one day, one week, or perhaps even one month. 

To the extent that a market is informationally efficient, the expected rate of return on various assets should be viewed on a real or after‐inflation basis.

The level of anticipated inflation is incorporated into any nominal rate of the time value of money. 

A nominal interest rate is the rate of return measured in terms of a given currency without a downward adjustment for the potential effects of positive inflation. 

Inflation is the rate of change in the value of a currency relative to a basket of real assets with a positive inflation rate indicating that the value of the currency is declining. 

The anticipated inflation rate ($\pi$) is defined as a measure of the expected rate of change in the value of a currency measured through changes in overall price levels.

The Fisher effect (or Fisher equation) states that the nominal interest rate (i) is equal to the sum of real interest rate (r) and the expected inflation rate ($\pi$), when interest rates are expressed as continuously compounded rates. 

The real interest rate is annualized rate earned on default‐free fixed‐income investments, after adjusting the nominal rate downward for the effect of inflation.

The traditional Fisher equation is modified for anticipated income taxes by assuming a uniform tax rate (T) on nominal interest income. 

The modified Fisher equation expresses the nominal interest rate (i) as the combination of the real interest rate, r, and the anticipated rate of inflation ($\pi$), with an adjustment for the income tax rate, T

$$i = r + \frac{\pi}{1 - T}$$

Here, r, i and $\pi$ are continuously compounded rates. 

The Fisher equation is equal to the modified Fisher equation for the case of T = 0.

A nominal price is the stated price of an asset measured using the contemporaneous values of a currency.

A real price is the price of an asset that is adjusted for inflation through being expressed in the value of currency from a different time period. 

- Estimating the Term Structure of Interest Rates with Zero‐Coupon Bonds

The term structure of interest rates is the relationship between spot interest rates and their associated longevities (i.e. times‐to‐maturity).

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=5cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/2.6.2 Im28.png"}
\end{center}

The yield to maturity of a fixed‐income instrument is the rate that discounts all the promised cash flows of the instrument into a summed present value that equals the instrument's market price

- The Yield Curve and Its Approximation

Fixed‐income analysts use coupon bonds to estimate most/all of the maturity ranges of the term structure of interest rates, because zero‐coupon bonds are not available for longer maturities. 

A coupon bond with annual coupon of C is priced:

$$P_0 = \sum^T_{t=1} \frac{C}{(1+y)^t} + \frac{FV}{(1+y)^T}$$

The bond's yield to maturity (or simply yield), y, is the rate that solves the above equation.

A yield to maturity discounts each cash flow at same rate regardless of its longevity and, is formed as a mixture of spot rates associated with each cash flow.

Each cash flow should be discounted with a rate associated with its longevity.

However, yields are often used as a proxy for the term structure.

Yields‐to‐maturity are plotted against their corresponding terms‐to‐maturity and are described as yield curves that resemble the term structure of spot interest rates.

For zero‐coupon bonds, the yield to maturity and implied spot rate are identical because the zero‐coupon bond has only one cash flow.

\newpage

### Forward Interest Rates

- Implied Forward Rates

#### Example 1

Consider 1-year zero-coupon bond with face value of R100 and market value of R90.
If investor holds the bond to maturity, the return over the next year will be 11.11%.

Investor is contemplating selling 1-year bond immediately, and rolling proceeds into a 2-year R100 face value zero-coupon bond with market value of R80 per R100 of face value (offering yield based on annual compounding of 11.8034%).

If investor rolled over the full sales price (R90) into 2-year zero-coupon bond, the principal amount/face value is purchased at R112.50 (i.e. $\frac{R90}{R80} \times R100$).
The incremental cash flows of moving from 1-year bond to 2-year bond are below:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=3cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/2.6.3 Im29.png"}
\end{center}

=>

The return on incremental cash flows between year 1 and 2:
$$\frac{R112.50 - R100}{R100} = 12.50 \%$$

i.e. incremental cash flows indicate that the investor has R100 less in one year and R112.50 more in two years by exchanging the one‐year bond for the two‐year bond. 

12.50% is implied return of investing between periods 1 and 2 in the 2‐year bond, known as an implied forward rate.

An implied forward rate, $F(t, T)$, is the annual return between time t and T, inferred from the term structure of interest rates.

- Implied Forward Rates with Annual Compounding

Consider an investor weighing two choices:

  i) Invest for T years at $r_T$, or
  
  ii) Invest for a shorter period (t) at rate $r_t$ and then reinvest proceeds into a forward rate, $F(t, T)$ for the remaining $T-t$ years.

In the absence of default risk, these alternatives generate identical returns in a perfect market since they each generate riskless proceeds in T years

Setting future values of R1 in T years from both alternatives equals:
$$(1 + r_T)^T = (1+r_t)^t \times \left( 1 + F(t, T) \right)^{T-t}$$

Thus, solving for $F(t, T)$:

$$F(t, T) = \left( \frac{(1+r_T)^T}{(1+r_t)^t} \right)^{\frac{1}{T-t}}- 1$$

- The Term Structure of Implied Forward Rates

The two most common choices with which to plot a term structure of forward rates are one year ($T - t = 1$) and infinitesimal (when $T - t \rightarrow 0$).

A common structure in interest rate analysis is the term structure of implied forward rates.

The term structure of implied forward rates is the relationship between implied forward rates and starting point of each rate and is often superimposed on the term structure of spot rates. 

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=5cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/2.6.3 Im30.png"}
\end{center}

Given the relation for spot and forward rates, it's clear that the forward rate will lie above (below) the spot rate in the case of an upward (downward) sloping spot rate. 

The gap between the two tends to diminish from left to right. 

The forward rate tends to "exaggerate" slope changes in the spot rate because the spot is an averaged rate while the forward rate is a marginal rate.

\newpage

### Arbitrage‐Free Models

Arbitrage is the attempt to earn riskless profits (in excess of risk‐free rate) by identifying and trading relatively mispriced assets. 

- Underlying Concept of Arbitrage‐Free Models

An arbitrage‐free model is financial model with relationships derived by the assumption that arbitrage opportunities do not exist, or at least do not persist.

Pure arbitrage requires no risk bearing.

Pure arbitrage opportunities exist when identical assets can be traded at different prices, allowing the arbitrageur to buy at lower price, sell at higher price.

In currency triangle, the profit is made until the assets converge and trade in parity.

Arbitrage‐free pricing models are based on assumption that in absence of transaction costs, taxes, or other trading restrictions, identical assets must trade at identical prices.

In imperfect markets, arbitrageurs speculate that prices of identical assets will converge through time.

A key externality of arbitrage activities is that they tend to drive similar assets toward similar prices which improves global economic decisions. 

Better asset prices serve as signals of more accurate information to producers and consumers, which enables supply and demand to be balanced at more efficient levels.

- Applications of Arbitrage‐Free Models

True to purest definition of arbitrage, the models discussed are limited to those models containing little or no risk.

1) arbitrage‐free pricing models

involve instantaneous transactions, such that arbitrage activity is concluded within seconds. 

are used in the analysis of interest rates, foreign exchange rates, derivatives, and other areas, such as cash‐and‐carry trades.

are relative pricing models, which prescribes the relationship between two prices.

2) absolute pricing models

attempts to describe a value/price level based on its underlying economic factors.

tend to be imprecise, since the model is based on bold assumptions and estimates about which investors have highly heterogeneous beliefs.

Relative pricing models are quite precise. 
It's the precision of relative pricing models that drives the usefulness of arbitrage‐free pricing models. 

Arbitrage‐free pricing models tend to be used wherever relative pricing models are well developed and accurate.

- Arbitrage‐Free Pricing in Spot Markets

The spot market or cash market is any market in which transactions involve immediate payment and delivery: The buyer immediately pays the price, and the seller immediately delivers the product. 

All transactions involving financial securities have deferred delivery generated by the settlement period.

Deferred delivery of spot (or cash) transactions is quite short and exists merely for convenience in facilitating the procedures necessary to settle the transaction.

Arbitrage‐free pricing in spot markets involves identifying two sets of transactions with identical outcomes and requiring that their prices be equal.

An arbitrage‐free pricing model of foreign exchange rates describes the relationships that must exist between all exchange rates such that no investor or speculator could earn a profit through instantaneous trading among the currencies.

The skeleton of this arbitrage‐free pricing model and other sophisticated models is based on two steps: 

  i) identify two economically equivalent sets of assets or transactions, and 
  
  ii) set their values equal to form a relationship based on underlying determinants of their values. 

- Carry Trades with and without Hedging

Carry trades are a set of long and short positions intended to generate perceived benefits through time, such as enhanced return, as the positions are "carried."

Carry trades can either be hedged or be exposed to the risks of price changes.

#### Example 2

Consider investor observing a 1‐year default‐free bond in a particular foreign currency offering a 5% yield, whereas a default‐free bond in the investor's domestic currency with same maturity offers a yield of only 4%. 

The investor shorts domestic bond (i.e. borrows in domestic currency) at cost of 4% and locks in 5% yield in the foreign currency by purchasing foreign bond with borrowed cash. 

=> 

The carry trade offers interest spread of 1% but is exposed to the risk that foreign currency will weaken in value relative to domestic currency. 

If foreign currency weakens by more than 1% per year over the lifetime of the trade, the losses will exceed the 1% per year net income. 

To the extent that interest rate differentials reflect expectations of different inflation rates, the investor should expect foreign currency to weaken by amount that offsets interest rate spread on a risk‐adjusted basis.

Investor faces risk that proceeds of foreign bond may be insufficient to settle the short position in domestic bond at end of the trade. 

Investor may decide to hedge the risk of this carry trade by locking in exchange rate ahead of time between foreign and domestic currencies. 

Investor could use derivatives (i.e. forward contract) to lock in the rate to exchange the principal amount received in the foreign currency when the long position in foreign bond matures for the amount due in the domestic currency. 

The key to the hedge is to allow the investor the opportunity to exchange the proceeds of the long position to cover the obligation of the short position at a pre-negotiated value. 

Since the investor is fully hedged against risk, the investor should only be able to receive the riskless return in an informationally efficient market.

\newpage

### Binomial Tree Models

used to model a variety of risks, from equities to interest rates. 

used as no‐arbitrage models to value risky securities, especially financial derivatives.

Call option is a financial derivative that provides its owner the right (but not obligation) to purchase an asset at a pre-specified price on (or before) the option's expiration date.

- The Mechanics of a Binomial Tree That Lead to a Normal Distribution

A binomial tree projects possible outcomes in a variable such as a security price or interest rate by modeling uncertainty as two movements: an upward movement and a downward movement.

The movements are modelled so that a pathway with an upward movement followed by a downward movement “recombines” with a pathway with a downward movement followed by an upward movement.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=4cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/2.6.5 Im31.png"}
\end{center}

Trees recombine when upward movements are formed via multiplicative shift factor, $S_u = S \times (1+u)$, and downward movements are formed via division by same factor,​$S_d = \frac{S}{(1+u)}$.

A recombining binomial tree has $n+1$ possible final outcomes for an $n$ period tree, rather than $2^n$ outcomes, and is more manageable for models with 30 or more time steps, since $2^{30}$ exceeds 1 billion, while a recombining 30‐step tree would have 31 final outcomes.

Each step occurs over a unit of time specified by the modeller.

A key attribute of binomial trees is that as the number of steps used increases (i.e. as total time period is broken into smaller and smaller steps), the terminal distribution of the asset approaches a normal distribution. 

#### Example 3

Consider stock price currently at R7 per share is expected to rise over the next year to R12 per share or fall to R0 per share, depending on the outcome of a very important event. 

Assume there's a call option on that stock with strike/exercise price of R9 per share that expires in one year. 
At expiration, call option will pay R3 if stock rises to R12, or R0 if stock falls to R0. 

=>

The below is single‐period binomial trees for stock and call option.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=3cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/2.6.5 Im32.png"}
\end{center}

It's still possible to know the value of a 1‐year call/put option with knowing probability of stock rising/falling, using the principles of arbitrage‐free modeling.

The payoff of call option is $\frac{R3}{R12} = 0.25$, times payoff of stock, i.e. $0.25 \times R12 = R3.$

Thus call option with strike price $R9$ must sell for one-quarter the price of stock, currently priced $R7$ or
$R7 \times 0.25 = R1.75$ (assuming no dividends).

- The Nature and Power of a Risk‐Neutral Model

A risk‐neutral model is a framework for valuing financial derivatives in which risk preferences and probabilities of price changes do not alter the solution and in which the analyst selects risk‐neutrality as the model's underlying assumption with regard to risk preferences. 

The probabilities and risk premiums offset each other so there exist an infinite number of possible pairs of risk aversion and probabilities. 

There exists an infinite number of possible probabilities and risk premiums, thus analyst can pick the most convenient scenario, which is the risk‐neutral scenario. 

In risk‐neutral scenario, all discount rates are riskless rate and all probabilities found are ones that allow price of risky asset to match its model value.

- The Advantage to Binomial Tree Models and Their Extensions

The primary advantage to binomial models is flexibility to incorporate important features such as cash distributions, decisions by corporations to call (buy back) securities, and decisions by investors to exercise options prior to their expiration or to prepay loans.

Binomial tree models can be based on interest rates (for valuing fixed‐income securities), exchange rates (for currency derivatives), or two factors (e.g. interest rates and stock prices to value convertible bonds). 

Another extension is the use of trinomial models, in which each price is allowed to have three outcomes.

\newpage

### Single‐Factor Default‐Free Bond Models

A single‐factor default‐free bond model explains the systematic dispersion in bond returns using a single explanatory variable.

- Traditional Duration

Like any single‐factor measure of interest rate risk, duration is limited in its effectiveness to the type(s) of interest rate risks for which it's designed.

The single interest rate risk being addressed is the risk of an instantaneous, parallel (or additive), and infinitesimal shift in the term structure of interest rates. 
Default risk is disregarded. 

These assumptions enable derivation of a bond's duration for a wide spectrum of securities. 

Duration‐like risk measures exist for other types of shifts, but traditional duration is the most common risk measure.

Duration is the elasticity of a bond price with respect to a shift in its yield (or uniform shift in the spot rates, corresponding to each prospective cash flow).

$$- \frac{1}{P_0} \times \frac{dP_0}{dy} = D$$
where $D$ is duration, $P_0$ is current bond price, and $y$ is bond yield.

This assumes $y$ (or each spot rate) is expressed as a continuously compounded rate.

The elasticity described in equation above is based on the bond's yield to maturity. 

Each cash flow of a bond should be discounted with a spot rate based on its time to receipt.

The use of spot rates raises two practical problems: 

  i) spot rates can be difficult to estimate, and 
  
  ii) if spot rates are used to value each cash flow, the sum of present values of each cash flow will not be exactly equal to the bond's market price.

In the case of a fixed‐coupon bond, the elasticity inthe equation above is the weighted average of the longevity of the bond's cash flows.

- Duration for a Fixed‐Coupon Bond

The duration of a fixed‐coupon bond is weighted average of longevities of cash flows to coupon bond where the weight of each of the bond's cash flows is the proportion of the bond's total value attributable to that cash flow.

$$D = \frac{\sum^T_{t-1} \frac{t \times C(t)}{(1+y)^t}}{P_0}$$
where $t$ is time, $C(t)$ is bond's promised cash flow for time $t$, $y$ is bond's ytm, and $P_0$ is bond's current value.

In the case of fixed‐coupon bond, the cash flows prior to $T$ are coupons and the cash flow at period $T$ is principal payment payment plus final coupon as applicable.

But two important features involve challenges:

  i) when interest rate compounding assumption is discrete (e.g. semiannual compounding), it introduces need to adjust $D$ through division by $\left( 1 + \frac{y}{m} \right)$ to create risk measure entitled modified duration.

Modified duration is a risk measure used with discrete compounding.

With continuous compounding, the adjustment factor disappears (as $m$ approaches infinity).

  ii) the underlying assumption of the earlier duration formula is that the volatility of a default‐free bond with respect to term‐structure shifts is directly proportional to its longevity. 
  This assumption is consistent with a parallel (or additive), instantaneous, and infinitesimal term‐structure shift.
  That is, each zero‐coupon bond will shift in proportion to its maturity.

A bond that has coupon rate that adjusts/floats to current interest rate levels has a substantial average longevity but little or no interest rate risk. 

- Implications of Compounding Conventions on Modified Duration

In debt markets, interest rates are expressed based on semi-annual compounding.

Modified duration is interest rate risk measure very similar to regular duration that adjusts duration for discrete compounding in order to reflect the differing effects of various compounding conventions on measuring interest rate risk.

$$\text{Modified Duration } = \frac{\text{Duration}}{(1 + \frac{y}{m})}$$
where $m$ is no. of compounding periods per year, $y$ is annual yield/interest rate, and $\frac{y}{m}$ is periodic non-annualized rate.

The stated annual rate does not include the effects of interest compounded on interest.

A 1% shift in continuously compounded rates has a relatively large effect on bond prices because effective annual rates (which incl. effects of compounding) are more responsive to shifts in continuously compounded rates than to shifts in rates that are not compounded. 

- Duration for a Bond Portfolio

Investors use duration to manage risk of a portfolio to a target level or to attempt to eliminate risk (hedge). 

Interest rate immunization is the process of protecting the value of a position against shifts in interest rates. 

A portfolio is immunized with respect to specified shifts (or all interest rate shifts), if the value of portfolio is independent of the shifts.

The traditional approach to interest rate risk management involves managing a portfolio's duration. 

The duration for a portfolio is simply a weighted average of the durations of the portfolio's constituent assets, such as the duration for a coupon bond is a weighted average of the durations of its prospective cash flows.

#### Example 4

Consider all market interest rates are currently 5%, compounded semi-annually. 
An investor has two bonds in a portfolio:

  1) A R1,000 face value 1‐year, 5% coupon bond (with semi-annual coupon payments), and
  
  2) A R2,000 face value, 5‐year zero‐coupon bond
  
What is the duration of the investor's portfolio?

=>

The duration of 5‐year zero‐coupon bond is 5.
To calculate duration of the 1‐year bond, view the bond as a portfolio of two cash flows:

  i) R25 cash flow (coupon) due in 6 months with present value (i.e. market value) of R24.39 (i.e. $\frac{R25}{1.025}$), and 
  
  ii) R1 025 cash flow (principal plus interest) with value of R975.61 (i.e. $\frac{R1025}{1.025} \times \frac{1}{1.025}$).
  Duration of 1-year bond = $\left( \frac{R24.39}{R1000} \times 0.50 \right) + \left( \frac{R975.61}{R1000} \times 1.00\right) = 0.988$

Then

$$\text{Current value of portfolio} = R1000 \text{ (coupon bond) } + R2000 \times (1.025)^{-10} \text{ zero-coupon bond}$$ 
  $$= R2 562.30$$
The duration of the portfolio is formed as a value‐weighted average of the durations of its assets
$$\left( \frac{R1000}{R2562.30} \times 0.988 \right) + \left( \frac{R1562.40}{R2562.30} \times 5.0 \right)$$
  
- Managing the Duration of a Long‐Only Bond Portfolio to a Target

Traditional investing focuses on long‐only positions in bonds.

The target duration of investor emanate from several goals:

  i) investor has horizon point in time at which they're concerned with the uncertainty of the portfolio's value, such as the end of a reporting period
  
  ii) investor has a set of projected cash needs and wants to be assured those needs can be funded by the portfolio
  
  iii) investor views duration as a measure of short‐term price risk and wishes to control the short‐term price risk by controlling the duration, in tandem with efforts to predict interest rate shifts and use market timing in an attempt to add return.

The investor selects a target duration for the portfolio and manages the portfolio's duration to meet their goals through protection against infinitesimal, parallel, instantaneous shifts in interest rates.

#### Example 5

Consider an investor has two bonds in a portfolio:

  i) R1 000 of market value in a 10‐year zero‐coupon bond, and

  ii) R1 000 of market value in a five‐year zero‐coupon bond

If investor wishes to be immunized to a horizon point of 7 years, what transactions should be executed?

=>

The investor's current duration is 7.5 (i.e. $0.5 \times 5 + 0.50 \times 10$).
To obtain target duration of 7 years, select portfolio weights based on market values ($w$) for the five‐year bond and ($1 − w$) for the 10‐year bond:
$$(w \times 5) + (1-w) \times 10 = 7 \hspace{10pt}  \rightarrow w = 0.60$$

Thus, R200 of 10-year bond should be sold to lower its weight to 40% $\left( \frac{R800}{R2000} \right)$, and used to purchase more 5-year bond to weight 60% $\left( \frac{R800}{R2000} \right)$).

- Duration for Securities with Stochastic Cash Flows

The responsiveness of price of floating‐rate bond (i.e. coupon rates that adjust with interest rate levels) to interest rate shifts approaches zero, as the speed with which the coupon adjusts to the short‐term interest rate approaches zero.

A floating‐rate bond's duration is based on its coupon‐reset period rather than its maturity is best understood by focusing on the sensitivity of the bond's price to interest rate changes.

That is, fixed‐coupon bonds are interest rate sensitive because their cash flows are fixed.

Floating‐rate bonds are only interest rate sensitive when their coupons adjust slowly/partially to interest rate changes.

The value of the fund that continuously pays its owners the short‐term interest rate on its principal amount is immunized against interest rate shifts.

A money market asset paying a rate that floats up and down with short‐term market interest rate is immunized with respect to any term‐structure shift. 

A floating‐rate or adjustable‐rate bond offers the same future cash flow stream as this money market account and thus fully immunized against any interest rate shifts, to the extent that the bond's rate adjusts instantaneously to market interest rate changes.

A floating rate or adjustable rate bond that adjusts its coupon rate with a delay of $t$ years will have same interest rate sensitivity as t‐year zero‐coupon bond:
$$\text{Duration of Floating Rate Bond} = \text{Time to Next Reset Period}$$

Many fixed‐income securities contain options such as prepayment option of mortgage borrower and callability of many corporate bonds. 

The durations for these securities require a valuation model for which analysts may calculate an elasticity. 

Similarly, other securities requiring advanced modeling include options on bond prices and interest rates.

- Implications of Floating Rates vs Fixed Rates on Interest Rate Risk

Floating‐rate notes respond differently to interest rate shifts than fixed‐rate notes do. 

Floating‐rate coupons reset periodically to new market interest rates levels, avoiding the level of interest rate risk inherent in fixed‐rate notes.

Floating‐rate note prices are less volatile and have lower durations.

#### Example 6

Consider floating‐rate note that resets semi-annually new interest rate of 1% above SOFR (benchmark interest rate for many floating‐rate notes trading at/near par). 
If floating‐rate note resets to new interest rate level every six months, its price will move to par at each reset because the note at that point in time is offering market yield. 
In period between coupon resets, there’s not a lot of time for interest rate on the loan to move far away from market level of interest rates. 
The duration of floating‐rate note is equal to its remaining time to reset. 
A floating‐rate note with semi-annual reset will have duration that declines from roughly 0.5 years (immediately after each reset) to roughly zero as time to next reset declines from 0.5 years to zero.

#### Example 7

A fixed‐rate bond and floating‐rate note each have 5‐year maturity. 
The fixed‐rate bond has duration of 4.5 years.
The floating‐rate note will reset its coupon to market rates in 0.5 years. 
Approximating bond price changes as the product of duration and interest rate shifts (times minus one), if continuously compounded interest rates increase by 1.5%, how much will the price of fixed‐rate bond and floating‐rate note decline?

$$\text{Duration } \times \text{Interest rate shifts} \times -1$$
=>

  i) price of fixed‐rate bond will drop by approximately 6.75% (4.5 duration × 1.5% rate rise)

  ii) price of floating‐rate note will drop by approximately 0.75% (0.5 duration × 1.5% rise).

With a semi-annual reset, the worst thing that could happen from perspective of an investor in that loan is that market rate increases the day after the semi-annual reset, i.e. it'll be earning a below‐market interest rate for the next 6 months. 

However, 6 months from now, that interest rate is going to adjust to the now‐higher level of market interest rates. 

Duration risk only exists during length of time between now and next reset date. 

Thus, floating‐rate notes have a lower price risk relative to a change in interest rates than a fixed‐rate note does.

  i) When interest rates rise, notes with shorter durations decline less in value than notes with longer durations. 

  ii) When interest rates fall, notes with longer durations rise more in value than notes with shorter durations. 

Fixed‐rate bonds have longer durations and floating rate loans have shorter durations even if their maturities are the same (and it's prior to last reset period). 

NB: ignoring possible default risk, a floating‐rate bond that resets continuously to short‐term (overnight) market interest rates has the same interest rate risk profile as cash.

While floating‐rate debt has less interest rate risk than fixed‐rate debt, the majority of floating‐rate debt is unrated or of lower credit quality. 

When moving from fixed‐rate debt to floating‐rate debt to reduce interest rate risk, investors understand that they may be increasing credit risk as a result of this reallocation. 

Investors may trade increased credit risk for reduced interest rate risk when moving from relatively higher‐rated fixed‐rate bonds to relatively lower‐rated floating‐rate loans.

- Duration as the Longevity of a Zero‐Coupon Bond of Equivalent Risk

Duration also relates the risk of a given instrument to a zero‐coupon bond. 

The duration of a zero‐coupon bond is equal to its time to maturity.

There's only one cash flow (principal at maturity) and the weighted‐average life of zero‐coupon bond is $T$ (its time to maturity).

A coupon/other bond with duration of 5 years, responds identically to a parallel, infinitesimal, and instantaneous shift in term structure as 5‐year zero‐coupon bond.

This interpretation of duration assists bond risk managers by allowing every security to be expressed using a reduced number of zero‐coupon bonds.

An important feature of long‐only bond portfolios that are immunized is that they tend to remain immunized as time passes, unless cash is received by investor (i.e. coupon/principal payments).

- Hedging or Immunizing a Long‐Short Portfolio with Duration through Time

A portfolio with long and short positions (long‐short) would be hedged and immunized if long positions had duration equal to duration of short positions.

A long‐short portfolio is immunized if portfolio has duration equal to horizon point at which investor anticipated using proceeds from portfolio.

However, long‐short portfolios raise a challenge with regard to passage of time. 

This is reason why duration is a perfect measure of risk when, among other things, there is instantaneous term structure shift.

#### Example 8

An investor has R1,000,000 portfolio with long positions that form duration of 5 years. 
Investor wishes to consider two alternatives: 

  i) adding R1,000,000 in short positions to hedge the portfolio or 
  
  ii) adding R500,000 in short positions to hedge the portfolio. 
  
What securities would provide immunization under the two scenarios? 

=>

The R1,000,000 long position with duration of 5 years can be hedged with R1,000,000 in short positions if short positions have duration of –5 years (i.e. short R1,000,000 of 5‐year zero‐coupon bonds or other assets that would have a positive duration of 5 if held long). 
The negative position implicit in short position will offset positive duration exposure of long position for an infinitesimal, parallel, and instantaneous shift in interest rates. 
In order to form a hedge with only R500,000 of short positions, the positions would need duration of –10 years, i.e. having R500,000 of market value short sold in 10‐year zero‐coupon bonds. 
The proceeds of short sales should be held in cash to avoid introducing further interest rate risk.

#### Example 9

An investor has R1,000,000 portfolio with long positions that form duration of 5 years. 
Investor's goal for portfolio is to have duration of 4 years because portfolio is to be liquidated at that time to fund a project. 
Investor wishes to add short positions to hedge the portfolio to duration of 4 years. 

=>

There are many solutions to this problem. 
Eg. investor could short R200,000 of 5‐year zero‐coupon bonds and hold proceeds from short sale in cash. 
Any combination of dollar amount $V$ and duration $D$ that solves the following equation would lower the duration to 4 years:

$$\left(R1000000 \times 5 \right) - \left( V \times D \right) = R4000000 \hspace{13pt} \rightarrow V \times D = R1000000$$

Long‐only bond portfolios matched to a horizon point duration tend to experience a decline in their duration that roughly matches the rate at which the time‐to‐the‐horizon point is declining (until a cash flow occurs). 

The same cannot be said of a long‐short portfolio.

- Extensions to Traditional Duration

Single (scalar) duration measures can be derived for any particular shift in the term structure.

The term structure often shifts in a non‐parallel (i.e. non‐additive) manner, so alternative duration measures for slope shifts and curvature shifts in the term structure have been engineered.

Duration is an elasticity based on a first‐order partial derivative to a nonlinear function, thus traditional duration hedging is subject to errors that are non-linearly related to the size of the interest rate shift.

The risk of finite‐sized shifts in the term structure are managed by considering higher moments. 

Whereas traditional duration is a first‐order elasticity, financial engineers use convexity to address second‐order shifts. 

Risk managers can use convexity (in addition to duration) to provide better hedging or management of the risks of large interest rate shifts. 

Convexity functions as a second‐order derivative.

### Reduced‐Form Modeling of Credit Risk

Credit models are employed to price illiquid securities that do not have reliable market prices and calculate hedge ratios.

- Intuition of Reduced‐Form Credit Risk Models

Credit models is divided into two groups: 

  i) structural models
  
explicitly take into account underlying factors that drive default process, such as volatility of underlying assets and structuring of cash flows (i.e. debt levels). 

directly relate the valuation of debt securities to financial characteristics of economic entity that issued the credit security. 

Structural credit models describe credit risk in terms of risks of underlying assets and financial structures that have claims to underlying assets (i.e. degree of leverage).
  
  ii) reduced‐form models

do not attempt to look at structural reasons for default risk. 

do not rely extensively on asset volatility or underlying structural details, such as degree of leverage, to analyze credit risk. 

Reduced‐form credit models focus on default probabilities based on observations of market data of similar‐risk securities. 

That is, they model the observed relationships among yield spreads, default rates, recovery rates, and frequencies of rating changes throughout the market. 

Credit risk is understood through analysis and observation of market data from similar credit risks rather than through underlying structural details of entities, such as amount of leverage.

- Expected Loss Due to Credit Risk

Expected credit loss of a credit exposure can be determined by three factors:

  i) Probability of default (PD) - specifies probability that counterparty fails to meet its obligations.
  
  ii) Exposure at default (EAD) - specifies nominal value of position that's exposed to default at time of default.
  
  iii) Loss given default (LGD) - specifies economic loss in case of default

The converse of LGD is the economic proceeds given default, i.e. recovery rate (RR). 

The recovery rate is percentage of credit exposure that lender ultimately receives through bankruptcy process and all available remedies.
$$\text{LGD} = (1 - \text{RR})$$
and
$$\text{Expected Credit Loss} = \text{PD} \times \text{EAD} \times (1 - \text{RR})$$

#### Example 10

Bank has extended R50 million 1‐year loan at interest rate of 14% to a client with a BBB credit rating. 
Suppose historical data indicate that 1‐year probability of default for firms with BBB rating is 5% and investors are able to recover 40% of notional value of unsecured loan to such firms. 
What is the expected credit loss?

=>

$$\text{Expected Credit Loss} = 5 \% \times \left( R50mil \times [1+0.14] \right) \times (1-0.40) = R1.71mil$$
Thus, if default actually occurs, Loss $ = 60\% \times R57 mil = R34.2 mil$

The expected loss of a portfolio of credit exposures is sum of expected credit losses of individual exposures.

Analysts are also concerned with understanding variation in potential credit losses. 

NB: variation of potential credit losses in portfolio of credit exposures is less than sum of variations of individual exposures due to diversification (imperfect correlation of the individual losses).

- Key Characteristics of the Risk‐Neutral Modeling Approach

A risk‐neutral approach models financial characteristics, such as asset prices, within a framework that assumes investors are risk neutral. 

A risk‐neutral investor requires the same rate of return on all investments, regardless of levels and types of risk because investor is indifferent with regard to how much risk is borne. 

Economic theory associates investor risk neutrality with investors whose utility/happiness is a linear function of their wealth.

The power of risk‐neutral modeling emanates from two key characteristics:

  i) Risk‐neutral modeling approach provides highly simplified and easily tractable modeling, and
  
  ii) Prices generated by risk‐neutral modeling must be same as prices in economy where investors are risk averse.

Risk‐neutral price modeling is greatly simplified by not having to either differentiate between systematic and idiosyncratic risks or estimate risk premium required to bear systematic risk.

Under specific conditions, prices obtained in risk‐neutral framework can be theoretically proven to be same as prices that exist in a world of risk‐averse investors.

Risk‐neutral pricing provides extremely simplified frameworks to price assets in a risk‐averse world.

- Pricing Risky Bonds with a Risk‐Neutral Approach

Consider a risky zero‐coupon, 1‐period debt with face value of $K$ (i.e. promising cash flow of $K$ at maturity in 1 period). 

Given expected recovery ($RR$) for this bond in case of default, the bond has expected payoff of $K \times RR$, with PD $(\lambda)$, and payoff of $K$ in absence of default with probability $(1-\lambda)$.

Given the bond's forecasted cash flows, the current value (time 0) of the 1‐period bond,$ B(0,1)$, is expressed in risk‐neutral model as sum of the probability‐weighted and discounted cash flows
$$B(0, 1) = \lambda \times \frac{K \times RR}{(1+r)} + (1 - \lambda) \times \frac{K}{(1+r)}$$
$$= \frac{K}{(1+r)} \times \left( RR \times \lambda + [1-\lambda] \right)$$

A probability of default weights the cash flows associated with the two outcomes (default and no default).

Both potential cash flows (cash flow in event of default and cash flow in absence of default) are discounted at riskless interest rate, $r$.

Risky cash flows are discounted at riskless rate due to assumption of risk neutrality and it's a technique used in risk‐neutral arbitrage‐free modeling.

Under assumption of risk neutrality, investors do not require premium for bearing risk. 

In risk‐neutral modeling, every discount rate is equal to riskless rate. 

In risk‐neutral model, probability of default $(\lambda)$, is known as risk‐neutral probability.

A risk‐neutral probability is a probability‐like value that adjusts the statistical probability of default to account for risk premiums.
 
A risk‐neutral probability should not be interpreted as the probability of default that would occur if investors were risk averse.
 
Investors are not risk neutral, they demand a premium for investing in risky investments. 
 
Other approaches to risk adjustment include use of higher discount rates and reduction of expected cash flows (the certainty‐equivalent approach).
 
The price of the risky bond is equal to the price of an otherwise risk‐free bond i.e. $\frac{K}{(1+r)}$ times adjustment factor that accounts for probability of default and expected recovery, i.e. $RR \times \lambda + (1-\lambda)$. 

The price of risky debt declines as probability of default $(\lambda)$ increases, or expected recovery rate $(RR)$, declines. 

Risk‐neutral models use a value of $\lambda$ greater than the true default probability in order to reduce the values of risky cash flows relative to safe cash flows.
 
- Credit Spreads

A bond price is determined by its credit spread $(s)$, i.e. the current price (time zero) of debt due in 1 year using credit spread:
$$B(0, 1) = \frac{K}{1+r+s}$$

The risk premium required to hold risky bond is expressed through use of higher discount rate: the addition of credit spread $(s)$ to the riskless rate $(r)$.

By setting the last two equations equal to each other, the risk‐neutral default probability can be related to the credit spread,
$$\lambda = \frac{1}{1-RR} \times \left( \frac{s}{1+r+s} \right)$$
$$\lambda \approx \frac{s}{1-RR}$$

If short‐term rate and spread are not very large, then the above equation approximately holds.

That is, risk‐neutral probability of default $(\lambda)$ is equal to credit spread divided by expected loss given default, or $(1 − RR)$.

#### Example 11

Suppose risk‐free rate is 5% per year and 1‐year, zero‐coupon corporate bond yields 6% per year. 
What are precise and approximate risk neutral probabilities of default?

=>

Assuming recovery rate of 80% on corporate bond, the precise risk‐neutral probability of default is estimated as 
$$\lambda = \frac{1}{1-0.80} \times \left( \frac{(0.06-0.05)}{1+ 0.05 + (0.06-0.05)} \right) = 4.7 \%$$

The approximate risk‐neutral probability of default is $$\frac{(0.06-0.05)}{1-0.80} = 5 \%$$

Thus, credit spread depends on probability of default and recovery rate
$$s \approx \lambda \times (1-RR) $$

In risk‐neutral world, bondholders demand a yield premium on risky bond (i.e. spread) that compensates them for expected losses on the bond due to default.

- Applying the Reduced‐Form Models Using Risk Neutrality

The actual probability of default will be less than $\lambda$ to extent that investors demand a risk premium.

The risk‐neutral probability implied by one bond, presumably a highly liquid publicly traded bond, can be used as a tool for pricing other bonds. 

The reduced‐form credit model approach utilizes riskless interest rates as discount rates much like arbitrage‐free option pricing models use riskless rates rather than discount rates that contain a risk premium.

Reduced‐form approach uses pricing information obtained from more liquid segments of the market to price bonds that are less liquid. 

That is, information implicit in bond prices observed in highly competitive markets is used to calibrate a model used to price bonds that are less liquid. 

To calibrate a model means to establish values for key parameters in a model, such as default probability/asset volatility, using analysis of market prices of highly liquid assets.

Key application of reduced‐form model is to price alternative debt securities in the same structure, such as both senior and junior debt. 

Debt securities within same capital structure have same underlying assets and same probabilities of default (either the corporation defaults or not). 

The primary difference is the recovery rates. 

Senior debt should be expected to have higher recovery rates than junior debt, since senior debt has higher priority for liquidating cash flows in bankruptcy process. 

Reduced‐form models relate credit spreads to recovery rates, and can be used to determine relative prices of securities in the same structure that differ in seniority.

Reduced‐form models are also used to price illiquid securities based on information from liquid securities with different issuers. 

The credit spreads observed in competitively traded debt markets can be used to calibrate a reduced‐form model and generate relatively reliable estimates of risk‐neutral default probabilities. 

The estimated risk‐neutral default probabilities can then be used to determine appropriate credit spreads for bonds of similar total risk that are not frequently traded.

In reality, fixed‐income debt instrument represents a basket of risks: 

  i) risk from changes in term structure of interest rates that differ in size and shape; 
  
  ii) risk that the issuer will prepay the debt issue (call risk); 
  
  iii) liquidity risks; and 
  
  iv) risk of defaults, downgrades, and widening credit spreads (credit risk). 
  
Sophisticated reduced‐form models use prices and volatilities of riskless bonds to incorporate their effects on the prices of risky bonds.

- Advantages and Disadvantages of Reduced‐Form Models

Advantages include:

  i) Can be calibrated using derivatives such as credit default swap spreads, which are highly liquid.
  
  ii) Are extremely tractable and well suited for pricing derivatives and portfolio products. 
  The models can rapidly incorporate credit rating changes and used in absence of balance sheet information (e.g. for sovereign issuers)

Disadvantages include:

  i) Limited reliable market data with which to calibrate a model.
  
  ii) Can be sensitive to assumptions, particularly those regarding recovery rate.
  
  iii) Information on actual historical default rates is problematic. 
  That is, few observations are available for defaults by major firms or sovereign states.
  
  iv) Historical default rates on classes of borrowers (e.g. borrowers of particular ratings class) have limited value in prediction of future default rates to extent that economies undergo major fundamental changes.

Hazard rate is used in the context of reduced‐form models to denote default rate. 

The number is annualized and based on historical analysis of similar bonds or on expectations.

### Single‐Factor Equity Pricing Models

An asset pricing model is framework for specifying return or value of an asset based on its risk and future cash flows.

Asset pricing models are not mathematical exercises; they are ways of expressing the most fundamental issues related to investing: the nature of risks and returns of investment opportunities.

- Single‐Factor Asset Pricing

The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) provides a single‐factor asset pricing by demonstrating that the risk of overall market index is the only risk that offers a risk premium. 

CAPM is a general equilibrium model, meaning that it prices all assets rather than describing one or more relative pricing relationships.

$$\mathbb{E}(R_i) = R_f + \beta_i \left( \mathbb{E}[R_m] - R_f \right)$$
where

  1) $\mathbb{E}(R_i)$ - expected return on asset i
  
  2) $\beta_i$ - market beta of asset i
  
  3) $\mathbb{E}[R_m]$ - expected return on market portfolio
  
  4) $R_f$ - riskless rate of return

The expected return of any asset has two parts: 

  i) risk‐free rate to compensate investor for time value of money $(R_f)$ and 
  
  ii) risk premium to compensate investor for bearing the risk. 

The risk premium is combination of asset’s risk, or beta, and market risk premium, referred to as equity risk premium.

Equity risk premium (ERP) is expected return of equity market in excess of risk‐free rate. 

This risk premium may be estimated from historical returns or implied by stock valuation models, such as through the relationship between stock prices and forecasts of earnings.

A single‐factor asset pricing model explains returns and systematic risk using a single risk factor.

A REIT‐based single‐factor asset pricing model differs in important ways from CAPM
$$\mathbb{E}[R_i] = \alpha_i + \beta_i \left( \mathbb{E}[R_{\text{index}}] \right)$$

The above equation does not specify that all assets must be included in the index, or that the constant $(\alpha_i)$ is the riskless rate.

CAPM is the important case that describes an economy in which all investors diversify perfectly among all assets and achieve an equilibrium in which all investors allocate their assets between two portfolios: market portfolio and riskless portfolio.

- Ex Ante Asset Pricing

The above equation is the expectational (i.e. ex ante) form of CAPM.

Ex ante models explain expected relationships such as expected returns.
Ex ante means "from before."

Expected return expresses central tendency of asset i’s return. 

The actual return of asset i in a particular time period may differ from expected return either because the market earned more/less than expected or because asset i experienced an unexpected and idiosyncratic change in price.

The ex ante form of CAPM makes two powerful prescriptions that are relevant to analysis of alternative investments:

  i) the assertion that any and all rewards for bearing risk should only be available from bearing market risk, which can be fully measured by an asset's beta relative to the market portfolio. 
  
  ii) the assertion that investors should not be able to earn any additional expected return from bearing any other type of risk.

In equilibrium asset pricing model, participants do not seek to change their positions to exploit perceived pricing errors, because there are no discernible pricing errors based on available information, meaning there are no arbitrage opportunities.

If CAPM were true, then every investor would hold all risky assets in proportion to their size. 

  i) Risk‐averse investors would hold greater portion of their portfolio in risk‐free assets, and 
  
  ii) risk‐tolerant investors would hold greater portion of their wealth in risky market portfolio.

In idealized world of CAPM, no investor tries to beat the market by overweighting/underweighting any risky assets or by trying to time the market.

If CAPM were true, all investors would hold same portfolio of risky assets, and no further analysis or management would be required. 

CAPM is derived from assumption that many real‐world features are linked to alternative investments do not exist. 
CAPM is derived assuming that:

  i) no single trader can affect security prices, 
  
  ii) all investors can focus exclusively on market value of their wealth at end of same single period, 
  
  iii) all assets are publicly traded, 
  
  iv) all investors can short sell limitlessly, 
  
  v) all investors can borrow limitlessly at risk‐free rate, 
  vi) there are no taxes or transaction costs, 
  
  vii) all investors care only about mean and variance of an asset's return distribution, and
  
  viii) all investors have equal expectations about security returns

- Ex Post Asset Pricing

Systematic return is portion of an asset's return driven by a common association. 

Systematic risk is dispersion in economic outcomes caused by variation in systematic return. 

Idiosyncratic return is portion of an asset's return that's unique to an investment and not driven by a common association. 

Idiosyncratic risk is dispersion in economic outcomes caused by investment‐specific effects.

Actual returns deviate from expected returns due to unexpected effects. 

The unexpected portions of returns result from systematic and idiosyncratic risks. 

Systematic effects occur when a systematic risk factor is higher or lower than expected. 

Idiosyncratic effects are all effects that are not systematic.

The ex ante form of CAPM does not include an added expected return from idiosyncratic effects, since expected value (i.e. expected return) of all idiosyncratic effects must be zero.

This is because idiosyncratic risk is diversifiable.

If idiosyncratic risk bearing offered a risk premium, then investors could receive a higher expected return (rather than simply a lower total risk) from simply holding a diversified portfolio, which would represent an unsustainable arbitrage opportunity.

Ex post means "from afterward" or realized form of CAPM. 

An ex post model describes realized returns and provides an understanding of risk and how it relates to deviations of realized returns from expected returns.
$$R_{it} - R_f = \beta_i (R_{mt} - R_f) + \epsilon_{it}$$

The left side of equation is realized excess return of asset i relative to risk-free rate in time period t. 

The excess return of asset refers to excess/deficiency of the asset's return relative to reference benchmark/security.

The terms between equal sign and plus sign reflect the effect of market's realized return in time period t, or the effect of systematic risk on realized return of asset i in time period t. 

To the extent that realized return of the market differs from its expected return, an asset with non-zero beta realizes a return that differs from its expected return proportional to its beta. 

$\epsilon_{it}$ is the portion of the excess return that is due to the effect of idiosyncratic risk. 

Idiosyncratic returns include any effect on the return of asset i in time period t other than that which is correlated with the return of the market, such as impact of firm‐specific news. 

Taking expected value of each side of ex post CAPM equation and rearranging the terms returns the equation of ex ante form of CAPM

Essential attributes of ex post CAPM are that:

  i) $\mathbb{E}[\epsilon_{it}] = 0$, otherwise it'd appear in ex ante form of CAPM,
  
  ii) the return from idiosyncratic risk is not linearly correlated with return of market, because any such effects are captured through beta of asset.

The ex post CAPM equation can be viewed as both cross‐sectional and time‐series model, since one or more variables on each side are subscripted both by time (t) and by subject (i). 

The below equation provides insight into risk. 
It's formed by taking variance of both sides of above equation, assuming that $R_f$ and $\beta_i$ are constant and that correlation between $R_{mt}$ and $\epsilon_{it}$ is zero:
$$\sigma^2_i = \beta^2_i \sigma^2_m + \sigma^2_{\epsilon}$$
where

  i) $\sigma^2_i$ - variance of returns of asset i
  
  ii) $\sigma^2_m$ - variance of returns of market index
  
  iii) $\sigma^2_{\epsilon}$ - variance of idiosyncratic returns of asset i

Idiosyncratic risk vanishes when enough assets (that are not perfectly correlated) are added to a portfolio.

CAPM is faulted for its inability to describe real world accurately, especially its inability to describe the behavior of alternative investments. 

Alternative investment analysis focuses on the potential for multiple sources of systematic risk and on the potential to invest such that the expected idiosyncratic return $\left( \mathbb{E}[\epsilon_{it}] \right)$ is positive.

### Single‐Factor Models and Regression

- Ordinary Least Squares Regression

Ordinary least squares regression selects the intercept and slope that minimize the sum of squared values of residuals (i.e. values of $e_{it}$).

The use of ordinary least squares has several advantages:

  i) It's quick and easy, 
  
  ii) the slope coefficient that results has intuitive interpretation

Least squares regression generates unbiased and most likely estimates of slope coefficient and intercept if the error terms in the model are:

  i) normally distributed, 
  
  ii) uncorrelated, and 
  
  iii) homoskedastic (i.e. having same finite variance). 

Other criteria for fitting a model to data also exist.

- Outliers

Violations of assumption that error term in the model is normally distributed often occur when data are subject to very large outliers.

Fat tails (leptokurtic distributions) are synonymous frequent outliers.

Alternative investment returns are prone to being leptokurtic.

Large outliers dominate a regression, causing the estimates of slope and intercept to be driven too much by outliers, rather than by remaining, more representative data. 

Ordinary least squares regression seeks to minimize sum of squared residuals, and squaring of residuals can cause outliers to have disproportionately higher influence than observations closer to the mean.

A critical but often overlooked task in linear regression is visual observation of residuals of regression. 

At least two plots are advisable for important regressions:

  i) Residuals plotted on vertical axis against independent or explanatory variable on horizontal axis, and 
  
  ii) Time‐series residuals plotted on vertical axis against time on horizontal axis. 
  
Analyst should note extreme outliers to determine if residuals reflect data errors or economic fact. 

If extreme residuals are not the result of errors, analyst should determine if underlying economic behavior causing the observation warrants large level of influence that outlier has on estimated parameters. 

If outlier is caused by an event that can be reasonably expected to not recur, the outlier should be removed.

It's important not to remove outliers corresponding to gains or losses that are likely to be repeated.

- Autocorrelation

The simplest statistical regression procedures assume that the model's error terms are uncorrelated, including through time. 

Autocorrelation of error terms is violation of that assumption.

Violations of assumption that error term is uncorrelated through time occur when returns are autocorrelated. 

Many alternative investment return series are prone to autocorrelation due to smoothed pricing or illiquidity.

The Durbin‐Watson statistic is used to test for autocorrelation of residuals. 

If Durbin‐Watson statistic indicates autocorrelation, there are several well‐established statistical procedures for performing adjusted regressions that provide better results. 

First‐order autocorrelation is common in alternative investments and easy to address. 

- Heteroskedasticity

The simplest statistical regression procedures assume that variance of model's error terms is homoskedastic.

Heteroskedasticity is the opposite of homoskedasticity. 

In a regression, heteroskedasticity refers to a situation in which the variance of the error term varies. 

That is, variance of error term is correlated with an independent variable, vary through time, or related to some other variable or dimension. 

With homoscedasticity, the variance of error term is constant.

The same plots used for outlier examination should be used to detect heteroskedasticity (i.e. residuals plotted against independent variable and against time). 

In this visual analysis, the analyst looks for a pattern in dispersion of residuals, such as a <, >, <>, or >< pattern. 

That is, a < pattern would show increasing dispersion of residuals moving from left to right in the diagram. 

Heteroskedasticity is formally detected using various tests. 

The problem with regression results from data exhibiting heteroskedasticity is that estimated regression parameters are unduly influenced by data related to greatest variance in the error term. 

The most popular correction is weighted least squares, in which a weighting scheme is developed and applied to the data to reduce the importance of data subject to higher error‐term volatility.

- Interpreting Regression's Goodness of Fit

The explanatory power of regression is evaluated as its goodness of fit. 

The goodness of fit of regression is extent to which the model appears to explain variation in dependent variable. 

The r‐squared value of regression (coefficient of determination) is used to assess goodness of fit, especially when comparing models. 

In simple linear regression, r‐squared is squared value of estimated correlation coefficient between dependent variable and independent variable. 

Correlation, ranges from −1 to +1, with negative values showing an inverse relationship between two variables, and positive values denoting a direct relationship between two variables. 

Because r‐squared is equal to correlation coefficient squared, the range of possible values for r‐squared is between zero and 1 and expressed as percentage. 

When building/explaining financial relationships, larger values of r‐squared are preferred, everything else being equal, as independent variable is explaining a greater portion of variance in dependent variable.

r‐squared is also interpreted in an absolute sense.

An r‐squared such as 0.90 is described as meaning that independent variable explained 90% of variation in dependent variable.

This is interpreted as indicating that 90% of fund's returns were explained by systematic risk (i.e. exposure to market risk represented by index). 

The remaining value, $1-r^2$, is idiosyncratic risk, or risk not explained by market index. 

- Performing a t‐Test on Regression Parameters

The intercept of regression is interpreted as estimate of alpha, or skill of fund manager (if a fund's return is being analyzed), or superior risk‐adjusted return of a security (if a security's return is being analyzed). 

The slope coefficient of regression is interpreted as beta of the asset, a measure of the asset's systematic risk.

The parameter estimates of regression are examined for statistical significance using a t‐test.

A t‐test is a statistical test that rejects or fails to reject a hypothesis by comparing a t‐statistic to a critical value.

For each alpha and beta estimate, the t‐statistic is formed. 

The t‐statistic of a parameter is formed by taking the estimated absolute value of the parameter and dividing by its standard error. 

The resulting t‐statistic is compared to a critical value.

If t‐statistic exceeds critical value, the parameter estimate is deemed to be significantly different from zero. 

The critical value of t‐statistic is found from published lists of critical values based on two parameters: 

  i) degrees of freedom and 
  
  ii) desired significance level of the test.

### Hypothesis Testing

- Four Steps of Hypothesis Testing

Hypotheses are propositions that serve as foundation on which to analyze an issue. 

Hypothesis testing is process of developing and interpreting evidence to support and refute various hypotheses. 

Hypothesis tests follow the same four steps, in which the analyst does the following:

  i) States a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis to be tested
  
  ii) Designs a statistical test
  
  iii) Uses sample data to perform the statistical test
  
  iv) Rejects/Fails to reject null hypothesis based on results of the analysis

Null hypothesis is a statement that analyst is attempting to reject, that a particular variable has no effect or that a parameter's true value is equal to zero.

Alternative hypothesis is behavior that analyst assumes would be true if null hypothesis were rejected. 

Alternative and null hypotheses are stated in such a way that they are mutually exclusive.

Test statistic is variable analyzed to make inference with regard to rejecting/failing to reject null hypothesis. 

Significance level is used in hypothesis testing to denote a small number, such as 1%, 5%, or 10%, that reflects probability (that a researcher will tolerate) of null hypothesis being rejected when it's true. 

The selection of smaller probability for significance level is intended to reduce probability an unusual statistical result will be mistakenly used to reject a true null hypothesis. 

Confidence interval is range of values within which a parameter estimate is expected to lie with a given probability. 

Confidence interval is based on large probability, such as 90%, 95%, or 99%. 

A 90% confidence interval defines range within which a parameter estimate is anticipated to lie in 90% of tests given that null hypothesis is true. 

An outcome outside confidence interval provides researcher with indication that true parameter lies outside confidence interval.

Computations allow calculation of test statistic that's often standardized in the following form:
$$\text{Test statistic} = \frac{ \text{Estimated value} - \text{Hypothesized value}}{\text{Standard error of statistic}}$$

The assumptions of model are used to derive probability distribution for test statistic. 

Using that distribution, p‐value is estimated based on data. 

The p‐value is generated by statistical test that indicates probability of obtaining test statistic by chance that is equal to or more extreme than the one actually observed (under condition null hypothesis is true). 

The p‐value of test generated is compared to level of significance the researcher chose.

The analyst rejects null hypothesis when p‐value is less than level of significance

- The Error of Accepting a Hypothesis

If test indicates variable has not been found to be statistically different from predictions of null hypothesis, it does not mean the null hypothesis is true or even that it's true with some known probability.

Tests should be designed to disprove things thought possibly to be true, not to try to confirm those things that are hoped to be true. 

- Four Common Problems Using Inferential Statistics

Results of hypothesis testing are often interpreted incorrectly.

1) Outcomes with lower p‐values are interpreted as having stronger relationships than those with higher p‐values.

At best, p‐value indicates whether a relationship exists; it's not a reliable indicator of size and strength of relationship.

2) Failure to distinguish between statistical significance and economic significance.

Economic significance is extent to which a variable in an economic model has a meaningful impact on another variable in a practical sense.

One can be very statistically confident that one variable is related to another, but the size of the estimated parameter and the degree of dispersion in the explanatory variable may indicate that the parameter has only a minor economic effect in the model. 
Converse is also true.

3) p‐value is only as meaningful as the validity of the assumption regarding the distribution of test statistic. 

4) Major problem is when p‐value from a test is interpreted as unconditional probability that a statistically significant result it true. 

Since body of knowledge is less well‐established, false beliefs based on erroneous statistical interpretations are less easily identified and corrected with alternative investment analytics. 

- Type I and Type II Errors

A type I error (false positive) is when an analyst makes mistake of falsely rejecting a true null hypothesis. 

The term $\alpha$ is used to denote probability of type I error and not be confused with investment alpha. 

The symbol $\alpha$ is level of statistical significance of the test, and $1-\alpha$ is defined as specificity of the test.

A type II error (false negative) is failing to reject null hypothesis when it is false. 

The symbol $\beta$ is used to denote probability of type II error and not be confused with systematic risk. 

The statistical power of a test is equal to $1-\beta$.

An analyst may lower the chances of both types of errors by increasing the sample size.

\end{center}

With significance level of 5%, given null hypothesis is true, there is a 5% probability that null hypothesis will be mistakenly rejected (upper left box) and a 95% probability that the correct decision will be made and null hypothesis will not be rejected (lower left box).

\newpage

### Sampling and Testing Problems

- Unrepresentative Data Sets

The validity of statistical analysis depends on the extent to which the sample/data set on which the analysis is performed is representative of the entire population for which the analyst is concerned. 

When a sample, sub-sample, or data set is a biased representation of population, then statistical tests may be unreliable.

A bias is when sample is obtained/selected in a manner that systematically favors inclusion of observations with particular characteristics that affect the statistical analysis.

Selection bias is a distortion in relevant sample characteristics from characteristics of population, caused by sampling method of selection/inclusion. 

If selection bias originates from decision of fund managers to report or not to report their returns, then the bias is a self‐selection bias.

Survivorship bias is where sample is limited to observations that continue to exist through the end of the period of study.

- Data Mining vs Data Dredging

Data mining refers to vigorous use of data to uncover valid relationships.

The idea is that by using a variety of well‐designed statistical tests and exploring a number of data sources, analysts may uncover previously missed relationships. 

Data dredging/snooping refers to overuse and misuse of statistical tests to identify historical patterns. 

The difference is that data dredging involves performing too many tests, especially regarding historical relationships for which there are not a priori reasons for believing that the relationships reflect true causality. 

The problem with data dredging is not so much the number of tests performed as the failure to take the number of tests performed into account when analyzing the results.

Any empirical results should be analyzed not only in context of other research and economic reasoning but also through understanding of how many tests have been performed. 

Not only can this information be difficult to obtain/estimate, but it may also be intentionally masked by researchers attempting to bolster a particular view.

- Backtesting and Backfilling

Backtesting is use of historical data to test a strategy that was developed subsequent to observation of the data. 

Backtesting is valid method of obtaining information on the historical risk and return of a strategy, which can be used as an indication of the strategy's potential going forward. 

Backtesting combined with data dredging and numerous strategies can generate false indications of future returns. 

The reason is the strategy identified as most successful in the past is its performance driven by luck. 

One must be careful of allocating funds to investment managers who choose to report backtested results of their new model rather than actual returns of the disappointing old model that traded client money in real time.

Backtesting is dangerous when model involves overfitting. Overfitting is using too many parameters to fit a model very closely to data over some past time frame. 

Models that have been overfit tend to have a smaller chance of fitting future data than a model using fewer and more generalized parameters.

In alternative investments, backfilling refers to insertion of actual trading record of an investment into database when that trading record predates the entry of the investment into the database.

Backfilling of actual results can be appropriate technique, especially when done with full disclosure and when there is reasonable basis to believe that results will not create a substantial bias or deception. 

Data sets of investment fund returns sometimes include past actual results of funds in the data set when the sample of funds being included is not being assembled on the basis of past investment results. 

The danger with backfilling is backfill bias. 
Backfill bias (instant history bias) is when the funds, returns, and strategies being added to a data set are not representative of the universe of fund managers, fund returns, and fund strategies.

Instead, additions would generate an upward return bias because it'd be likely that data set would disproportionately add returns of successful funds that are more likely to survive and that may be more likely to want to publicize their results.

Backfilling can also refer to use of hypothetical data from backtesting. 

In investments in general, backfilling refers to the insertion of hypothetical trading results into a summary of an investment opportunity. 

A reason that backfilling rarely refers to inclusion of hypothetical trading results in the case of alternative investments that often focus on active trading strategies, in which hypothetical trading results would be highly discretionary and would be unsuited to hypothetical backfilling.

Backfilling can be deceptive even with innocent intentions. 

Often investors change/evolve their strategies as time passes, conditions change, and performance declines. 

Traders are likely to adapt their strategies in response to poor performance.

An investor who backtests a revised trading strategy and backfills the hypothetical performance into the track record of the current and revised strategy is clearly providing a biased indication of forward‐looking performance. 

The indication would be especially biased if revision in the strategy were in response to data from the same time interval on which the backfilling was performed.

- Cherry‐Picking and Chumming

Cherry‐picking is the concept of extracting/publicizing only those results that support a particular viewpoint

Chumming is a fishing term used to describe scattering pieces of cheap fish into the water as bait to attract larger fish to catch. 

In investments, this term is the practice of unscrupulous investment managers broadcasting a variety of predictions in the hope that some of them will turn out to be correct and thus be viewed as an indication of skill.

NB: Attractive results are not interpreted in the context of total number of experiments being conducted.
