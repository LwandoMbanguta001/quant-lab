# Topic 4: Private Equity

## SubTopic 4.3: Buyout

### An Overview of Buyouts

Buyout is a generic term that denotes a change of ownership.

A buyout occurs when capital, a mix of debt and equity, is used to acquire a controlling stake in an existing (private or publicly traded) company or subsidiary from its current shareholders.

The new owners operate the company as an independent organization as opposed to an acquisition, in which the acquired company is folded into the buyer’s existing company. 

Distinctions between buyouts focus on the purpose of buyout and management team that'll operate the target firm.

A buyout is described as an LBO when, after the buyout, the debt‐to‐equity ratio is much greater than before the acquisition.

The debt‐to‐equity ratio can be as high as 9:1, meaning the capital structure of the company after the buyout is 90% debt and 10% equity.

Regulatory changes and lending practices resulted in LBOs operating with a debt-to-equity ratio no greater than 6:1.

An LBO includes an effort to make fundamental changes in management and/or operations of the target.

- History of Leveraged Buyouts

The 1980s witnessed the rise of a key element of the growth in buyouts: financing of buyouts using bonds with low credit ratings, known as junk bonds. 

Junk bonds are debt instruments with high credit risk, i.e. high‐yield, non‐investment‐grade, or speculative‐grade debt.

- Three Key Economic and Agency Issues of Buyouts

  1. Are Buyout Markets Segmented and Informationally Inefficient?

Buyout activity was previously thought to take place in a segmented market.

Segmentation denotes grouping of market participants into clienteles that focus their activities within specific areas of the market, rather than varying their range of activities more broadly throughout all available opportunities. 

When a market is segmented, the valuations in that market vary based on preferences of clienteles that dominate particular segments.

Buyout activity was also previously thought to take place in an inefficient market. 

Inefficiency refers to informational inefficiency, the idea that transactions take place with relatively large divergences between actual prices of transactions and true underlying values of those transactions, based on all available information.

Segmentation can lead to informational market inefficiency.

An evolution of buyout market has occurred that has been driven by substantial buyout activity and resulted in a less segmented market that has grown into a more efficient, auction‐driven asset market, in which greater competition has reduced abnormal profit opportunities.

  2. Are Management Buyouts a Violation of Fiduciary Duties?

Buyouts have large economic consequences to both managers and shareholders of target firm. 

There is an inherent conflict of interest between shareholders as principals and managers as agents with regard to most buyouts.

That conflict of interest can become important in high‐stakes environment of buyouts. 

The primary conflicts involved in management buyouts are quite distinct from conflicts involved in management buy‐ins.

In an MBO, the existing management team takes over ownership of firm from the firm’s existing shareholders.

Managers owe a fiduciary duty to the shareholders of the firm in which they are employed.

Managers have superior information regarding the firm and its potential value.

In a management buyout, the incumbent managers perceive there are substantial gains that can be unlocked through their actions. 

A critical issue is whether managers choosing to pursue a path of unlocking those gains through a management buyout are violating their fiduciary responsibilities to the firm’s shareholders.

  3. Are Managers Perversely Incentivized with Regard to Management Buyins?
  
In an MBI, an external management team replaces the existing management team. 

The outcome of an MBI for incumbent managers can vary depending on the extent to which the managers are compensated upon their departure.

A generous compensation scheme (golden parachute) is given to top managers whose careers are being negatively affected by a corporate reorganization. 

Two primary conflicts of interest emanate from these lucrative compensation schemes:

  i) incumbent managers have a strong incentive to resist any buyout attempt (no matter how lucrative to shareholders) that displaces them as managers if buyout does not provide them with generous compensation. 
  
  ii) incumbent managers have a strong incentive to encourage buyouts that offer them generous compensation. 
  
Incumbent managers are incentivized to interfere with buyouts or promote buyouts based on the financial implications to themselves rather than based on their duties to serve the interests of the shareholders.

- Buyouts of Private Companies

Buyouts are distinguished from mergers by the extent to which the firm bought out is intended to function as a stand‐alone business rather than be folded into the organization of the purchaser. 

In a buyout of a private company, all equity is acquired and control is absolute.

The terms for purchasing control of a company are not universal or clearly delineated.

- Buyout Objectives

Investors in buyouts target lower internal rates of return (IRRs) than in venture capital, although both are quite high.

The reason VC‐required IRRs are higher is there's more risk funding a nascent company with brand‐new technology than an established company with regular and predictable cash flows.

A buyout of a private company is an alternative exit from an IPO, from the perspective of an early investor. 

The target company has an established product. 

The management of the company going forward is driven not by idea generation but often by improving efficiency. 

Revenues are established, recurring, and fairly predictable. 

With a buyout, capital is necessary not for product or service development (as in VC) but to optimize the company’s efficiencies with the ultimate goal of an IPO exit.

- Buyouts and Capital Structure Optimization

Large capital requirements and lower risk levels relative to VC result in most buyout managers making a smaller number of investments compared to venture capitalists. 

Buyout transactions use both equity and debt financing to acquire companies.

Assets of the acquired company are used as collateral for the debt, and the company’s cash flow is used to pay off the debt.

Buyout managers conduct intensive financial due diligence and rely on sophisticated financial engineering. 

Financial engineering refers to the process of creating an optimal capital structure for a company.

In private equity, the capital structure is made up of different types of financial instruments, such as multiple layers of debt, mezzanine, and equity, each carrying a different risk‐reward profile.

Buyouts use debt financing, either through bank loans or with newly issued debt to purchase the outstanding equity of the target company. 

These loans and bonds are secured by the underlying assets of the company being bought.

Mezzanine financing relates to capital provided through the issuance of subordinated debt, with warrants or conversion rights to finance the expansion or transition capital for established companies (usually privately held or below investment grade, or both). 

While mezzanine financing gives a more predictable cash‐flow profile, its unlikely to provide capital returns comparable to other PE financing forms.

- Buyouts and Operational Efficiency Optimization

A multitude of approaches to improving operational efficiency can be combined in a transaction, such as divestment of unrelated businesses, vertical or horizontal integration through acquisition, and company turnaround. 

Buyout managers need to give extensive advice on strategic and business planning, and focus on consistent rather than outsized returns.

Because they target established enterprises, buyout firms experience fewer outright failures but have upside potential more limited.

The ability to analyze a company’s operations and increase efficiencies, as opposed to implementation of capital structure changes, is the primary driver of a successful transaction.

- Merchant Banking

Merchant banking is closely related to buyouts that its sometimes difficult to distinguish between the two. 

Merchant banking is the practice whereby financial institutions purchase non-financial companies as opposed to merging with or acquiring other financial institutions.

Most major banks have merchant banking units.

These units buy and sell non-financial companies for profits they can generate, much as in the case of buyouts.

In some cases, merchant banking units establish limited partnerships, similar to buyout funds.

Merchant banking started as a way for investment banks and money center banks to establish an equity participation in the enterprises they helped fund. 

If a bank lent money to a buyout group to purchase a company, its merchant banking unit also invested some capital as equity capital and received an equity participation in the deal.

The merchant banking units of investment banks established their own buyout funds and created their own deals.

Whereas merchant banking is designed to earn profits for the bank, it allows the bank to expand its relationship with the buyout company into other money‐generating businesses, such as underwriting, loan origination, merger advice, and balance sheet recapitalization. 

All of this ancillary business translates into fee generation for investment bank.

### Buyout Strategies

- Types of Private Equity Buyouts and Resulting Management

A management buy‐in (MBI) is a type of buyout in which the buyout is led by an outside management team. 

Control of the new company is taken over by the new (outside) management team, and the old (incumbent) management team leaves. 

The compensation package, if any, offered to or negotiated by the incumbent managers can be a critical issue.

Buyouts involve bringing in a new management team to replace the firm’s existing management. 

A buyout led by the firm’s existing managers that retains most top members of the management team is referred to as a management buyout.

A management buyout (MBO) occurs when current management acquires the company with the assistance of buyout fund.

A buy‐in management buyout is a hybrid between an MBI and an MBO in which the new management team is a combination of new managers and incumbent managers.

In most large buyouts, a public company was being taken private.

Buyouts are taking the form of a secondary buyout.

In a secondary buyout (SBO), one private equity firm sells a private company to another private equity firm (also know as a sponsor to sponsor deal). 

In effect, a secondary buyout is an ownership change among private equity firms.

Secondary buyouts provide a secondary‐market‐like opportunity for private equity firms to exit a buyout. 

The performance of secondary buyouts in a PE fund depends on when the deal is closed relative to the fund’s investment period. 

A buyout fund that purchases a portfolio company through an SBO in the first half of the fund’s investment period sees that portfolio company perform in line with other investments in the fund. 

SBOs purchased late in the fund’s investment period, when the GP might be racing to close on deals simply to increase invested capital and subsequent management fees, underperform SBOs purchased earlier in the life of the fund as well as underperforming investments directly in portfolio companies

- Categories of LBOs

  1) "Traditional” Leveraged Buyout (LBO) - the private equity firm targeted a stable, cash flow positive firm that could be purchased using significant levels of debt. 
  So long the company could sustain cash flow, the debt could be serviced throughout the holding period, with any remaining cash flow used to pay down debt early and ultimately distributed dividends to equity holders. 
  If the company produced modest growth and could achieve an exit multiple in line with or above the entry multiple, the owners could reap massive gains through manipulating the balance sheet (given the negative connotation of financial engineering). 
  While this model creates substantial value for owners, its questionable whether the company is better off afterwards. 
  With majority of cash flow diverted to principal and interest payments, the company is unable to invest in capex and other growth initiatives, which result in falling behind industry peers.
  
  2) Operational Efficiency buyouts - are LBOs that in addition to using substantial debt, attempt to increase value to firm via operational efficiency improvements.
  A company is bought out because its shackled with a non-competitive operating structure.
  For large public companies with widespread equity ownership, management has little incentive to create shareholder value because it has a small stake in the company’s profit. 
  Under these circumstances, management is compensated based on revenue growth, which result in excessive expansion and operating inefficiencies. 
  Efficiency buyouts lead to a reduction in firm assets and revenue with the goal of increasing firm profits. 
  Such a buyout introduces more concentrated ownership and a better incentive scheme to mitigate agency problems. 
  Management is given a stake in the company with an incentive scheme tied not to increasing revenues but to increasing operating margins and equity value.
  A high leverage ratio is used to ensure that management has little discretion to invest in inefficient projects. 
  The buyout firm replaces the diverse shareholder base and provides the active oversight that was lacking with the prior widespread equity owners.
  At times, this model results in negative headlines for buyout industry, as its associated with layoffs and other cost reductions that are harmful to other stakeholders.
  The majority of large private equity firms retain in-house operational experts who can work with portfolio companies to boost operations, streamline costs, and increase operating margins.
  For much of the industry, Operational Efficiency buyouts are the “new” Traditional LBO.
  
  3) Carve-outs - occur when a private equity firm purchases a subsidiary or operating division from within an existing corporation. 
  These purchases produce Entrepreneurship stimulators, meaning the buyout creates value by helping to free management to concentrate on innovations. 
  The subsidiary or operating division is unwanted or neglected by its parent company, which impede its ability to implement an effective business plan. 
  A carve-out can free the operating division to control its own destiny.
  
  4) Spin-offs/Break-ups - Conglomerates have many different divisions or subsidiaries, operating in completely different industries. 
  These companies can be misunderstood by the investing public and perhaps undervalued. 
  Sometimes conglomerates drain profits from profitable divisions within the firm and use them to prop up failing divisions rather than reinvesting them in successful divisions or distributing them to shareholders as dividends. 
  A spin-off/break-up can be used to dismantle inefficient conglomerates, shut down or sell inefficient operations, and allow profitable divisions to reinvest and meet their growth potential.
  
  5) Buy‐and‐build strategy - is a buyout value‐creation strategy involving the synergistic combination of several operating companies or divisions through additional buyouts. 
  The buyout firm begins with one buyout and then acquires more companies and divisions that are strategically aligned with initial buyout portfolio company. 
  The strategy seeks to benefit from synergies realized through the combination of several different companies into one. 
  In some respects, this strategy is the reverse of that for conglomerates. 
  Rather than strip a conglomerate down to its most profitable divisions, this strategy pursues an assembling approach. 
  This is also known as a leveraged buildup or roll up.
  
  6) Turnaround strategy - is an approach used by buyout funds that look for underperforming companies with excessive leverage or poor management.
  The targets for turnaround buyout specialists come from two primary sources: (1) ailing companies on the brink of bankruptcy, and (2) underperforming companies in another buyout fund’s portfolio. 
  The private equity firm does not buy out the complete company but makes a large equity contribution at a price discounted to the public market price of the stock and takes seats on the target company’s board of directors.
  
  7) Growth Buyout - the buyout firm targets companies exhibiting above average growth rates, which means the company is earlier in the business life cycle.
  At this stage, risk is still elevated, and substantial use of debt is not possible, or too risky.
  Growth buyouts are funded with a majority of equity. 
  Given the positive trajectory of the company, the owners wish to retain a portion of the equity. 
  While growth buyouts result in a change in control, its not unusual for the buyout firm to not hold 100% of the equity after the transaction, and the original owners may still retain a 20%-40% ownership stake.
  
  8) Buyout-to-buyout (aka Sponsor-to-sponsor) - a private equity firm sells one of its portfolio companies to another buyout firm. 
  The original buyout fund may be late in the fund life (i.e. liquidation phase) and needs to exit the company. 
  The initial buyout fund was well suited for certain strategic initiatives while the new buyout owner is well suited for other strategic initiatives.

### Buyout Fund Characteristics

The dominant type of buyout in terms of aggregate size is the LBO.

- LBO Target Market by Cap Size

Leveraged buyout (LBO) funds distinguish themselves by size of the companies they take private. 

They classify themselves as investing in small‐capitalization companies, mid‐capitalization companies, or large‐capitalization companies.

The large‐cap category of LBOs includes super‐sized or mega LBOs. 

Investors classify funds within these strategies by evaluating the revenue and/or EBITDA of the target companies, or by looking at fund size. 

\begin{center}

\end{center}

Almost all LBO funds are structured as limited partnerships.

LBO funds are run by a general partner, an LBO firm. 
All investment discretion and day‐to‐day operations vest with general partner.

- Total Number, Size, and Implications of Buyout Fund Fees

LBO firms have numerous ways to make money, which include annual management fees, incentive fees, or carried interest.

For arranging and negotiating an LBO, an LBO firm may charge fees of up to 1% of total selling price to the corporation its taking private. 

Some LBO firms (i.e. GPs) keep all these fees for themselves rather than sharing them with limited partner investors.

Other LBO firms split the transaction fees, with LPs receiving 25% to 75%. 

Other LBO firms include all of these fees as part of the profits to be split up among the general partner and LPs. 

Not only do LBO firms earn fees for arranging deals, but also earn breakup fees if a deal fails.

In addition to these fees, LBO firms charge a divestiture fee for arranging the sale of a division of a private company after the buyout has been completed.

An LBO firm may charge directors’ fees to a buyout company if managing partners of the LBO firm sit on the company's board of directors after the buyout has occurred.

When the buyout industry started, the 1% to 2% management fee was necessary to pay the expenses of the PE general partner. 

This fee covered travel expenses, utility bills, and salaries of general partner's staff.

The management fee was originally used to keep the PE manager afloat until the incentive fee could be realized, which took several years. 

Now, PE funds have grown to immense size; the PE manager now earns a considerable amount of profit from its management fees. 

This blunts the incentive of PE manager to seek only the most profitable PE opportunities.

The large, diversified, private equity firms operate multiple funds across multiple strategies and are amongst the largest asset managers in the alternatives investment industry. 

Given the predictability in the cash flow from the management fee, and the level of profits earned from management fee, these firms were well situated to enter the public markets. 

Public investors are attracted to these firms in large part because of the profits generated by the management fee income as opposed to the incentive fee.

While managers of buyout funds offer their investors an 8% preferred return before they take a share of the profits for themselves, this is less common in the case of VC funds.

Its more important as an incentive to properly screen the deal flow.
Without it, buyout fund managers could pursue a low‐risk, low‐return strategy, by being inactive or by choosing companies that have little potential to generate large returns.

A preferred return forces managers to make riskier investments to generate a return in line with the investor's targets.

In the case of VC funds, investments are always risky, and the high‐risk, high‐reward strategy makes it meaningless to bother about preferred returns.
