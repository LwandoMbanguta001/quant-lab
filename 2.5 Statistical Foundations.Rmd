# Topic 2: Introduction to Alternative Investments

## SubTopic 2.5: Statistical Foundations

### Return Distributions

Risky assets experience unexpected value changes and therefore unexpected returns. 

If we assume investors are rational, the more competitively traded an asset, the more these unexpected price changes may be random and unpredictable. 

Thus asset prices and asset returns in competitively traded markets are modeled as random variables. 

Frequency and probability distributions provide starting points for describing asset returns.

- Ex Ante and Ex Post Return Distributions

Ex post returns are realized outcomes rather than anticipated outcomes. 

Future possible returns and their probabilities are expectational or ex ante returns.

Predictions are formed partially/fully through analysis of ex post (i.e. historical) data. 

The direct use of past return behavior as a predictor of future potential return behavior requires two properties to be accurate:

  i) Return distribution must be stationary through time, i.e. expected return and dispersion of the underlying asset do not change
  
  ii) The sample of past observations must be sufficiently large to be likely to form a reasonably accurate representation of the process

The requirements for past returns to be representative of the future returns raise a serious challenge:

  i) If past observation period is long, the sample of historical returns will be large; however, it's likely that the oldest observations reflect different risks or other economic conditions than can be anticipated in the future. 
  
  ii) If the sample is limited to the most recent observations, the data may be more representative of future economic conditions, but the sample may be too small to draw accurate inferences from it.

For a traditional asset, its plausible that the asset's past behavior is a reasonable indication of its future behavior.

In alternative investments such as hedge funds, return distributions change as the fund's investment strategies and use of leverage change through time.

Thus, forecasted (ex ante) return distributions may need to be based on economic analysis and modeling rather than simply projected from historical (ex post) data.

Whether based on prior observations or on economic analysis, the return distribution is a central tool for understanding the characteristics of an investment.

- The Normal Distribution

is the bell‐shaped symmetric distribution, where the left and right sides are mirror images of each other. 

The normal distribution clusters or peaks near the center, with decreasing probabilities of extreme events.

It tends to approximate many distributions observed in nature or generated as the result of human actions and interactions, including financial return distributions. 

The more competitively traded an asset's price is, the more the price change over a small unit of time would be the result of hundreds or thousands of independent financial events and/or trading decisions. 

Therefore, the probability distribution of the resulting price change should resemble the normal distribution.

- Log Returns and the Lognormal Distribution

Returns are predominantly reported using discrete compounding.

Log returns may offer an advantage when modeling a return probability distribution. 

The use of log returns allows for the modeling of different time intervals in a manner that is simple and internally consistent.

The highest possible simple (non‐annualized) return is $+ \infty$, while the lowest possible simple return for a cash investment is a loss of −100%, which occurs if the investment becomes worthless.

The normal distribution spans from $- \infty$ to $+ \infty$, meaning that simple returns cannot truly be normally distributed.

The normal distribution may be a poor approximation of the actual probability distribution of simple returns.

However, log returns can span from $- \infty$ to $+ \infty$. 

There are two equivalent approaches to model returns that address these problems: 

  i) Use log returns and assume that they're normally distributed, or
  
  ii) Add 1 to the simple returns and assume it has a lognormal distribution

In summary, it's possible for returns to be normally distributed over a variety of time intervals if those returns are expressed as log returns (and are independent through time).

If log returns are normally distributed, then the simple returns (i.e. 1 + R) are lognormally distributed.

However, if discretely compounded returns (R) are assumed to be normally distributed, they can only be normally distributed over one time interval, since returns computed over other time intervals would not be normally distributed due to compounding.

Many investors assume normality when forecasting (ex ante) returns, but this assumption is problematic.

For a more robust modeling practice, investors may consider log returns in order to minimize these statistical issues. 

The tradeoff being that log returns (i.e. continuous compounding) may not be a realistic assumption for the given return series.

### Moments of the Distribution

The moments of a return distribution are measures that describe the shape of a distribution. 

The first four moments are referred to as mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis.

- First Moment: Mean

Using historical data, for a sample distribution of n observations, the mean is typically equally weighted.

$$\text{Mean} = \bar{R} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i R_i$$

is used as an estimate of the expected value when observations from the past are assumed to be representative of the future.

- Second Moment: Variance

is the probability weighted average of the deviations squared.

By squaring the deviations, any negative signs are removed, so the variance becomes a measure of dispersion.

Variance is often estimated with a sample of historical data. 
For a sample distribution, the variance with equally weighted observations is estimated:

$$\text{Variance} = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_i \left( R_i - \bar{R} \right)^2$$

The use of $n-1$, rather than $n$, enables a more accurate measure of the variance when the estimate of the expected value of the variable has been computed from the same sample. 

The square root of the variance is an extremely popular and useful measure of dispersion known as the standard deviation/volatility:

$$\text{Standard Deviation} = \sqrt{\sigma^2} = \sigma$$

- Third Moment

is the expected value of a variable's cubed deviations.

Skewness is equal to the third moment divided by the standard deviation of the variable cubed and serves as a measure of asymmetry:

$$\text{Skewness} = \frac{ \mathbb{E}[ (R - \mu)^3] }{\sigma^3}$$

Skewness is dimensionless, since changes in scale of the returns affect the numerator and denominator proportionately, leaving the fraction unchanged.

By cubing the deviations, the sign of each deviation is retained.

Cubing the deviations provides a measure of the direction in which the largest deviations occur, since cubing causes large deviations to be more influential than the smaller deviations.

The measure of skewness provides a numerical measure of the extent to which a distribution flares out in one direction or the other.

  i) A positive value indicates that the right tail is larger (the mass of the distribution is concentrated on the left side)
  
  ii) A negative value indicates that the left tail is larger (the mass of the distribution is concentrated on the right side)
  
  iii) A skewness of zero can result from a symmetrical distribution

- Fourth Moment: Kurtosis

Kurtosis is an indicator of the size of the extreme tails of a distribution.

$$\text{Kurtosis} = \frac{ \mathbb{E}[(R - \mu)^4]}{\sigma^4}$$

In the case of a normally distributed variable, the estimated kurtosis has a value that approaches 3.0 (as the sample size is increased).

Some investment analysis may subtract 3.0 from the result to derive a measure, known as excess kurtosis.

Excess kurtosis provides a more intuitive measure of kurtosis relative to the normal distribution because excess kurtosis has a value of zero in the case of the normal distribution:

$$\text{Excess Kurtosis} = \left( \frac{ \mathbb{E}[(R - \mu)^4] }{\sigma^4} \right) - 3$$

  i) A positive excess kurtosis signals a level of kurtosis that is higher than observed in a normally distributed variable, 
  
  ii) An excess kurtosis of 0.0 indicates a level of kurtosis similar to that of a normally distributed variable, and 
  
  iii) A negative excess kurtosis signals a level of kurtosis that is lower than that observed in a normally distributed variable

Kurtosis is viewed as capturing the fatness of the tails of a distribution, with high values of kurtosis (or positive values of excess kurtosis) indicating fatter tails (i.e. higher probabilities of extreme outcomes) than are found in the case of a normally distributed variable.

The mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of a return distribution indicate the location and shape of a distribution, and are a key part of measuring and communicating the risks and rewards of various investments.

All else equal, analysts would prefer to avoid investment exhibiting left skew and high kurtosis revealing a (historical) return series with higher probabilities of extreme outcomes and larger left tails (assuming they're not shorting).

- Platykurtosis, Mesokurtosis, and Leptokurtosis

If a return distribution has no excess kurtosis, it's said to be mesokurtic, mesokurtotic, or normal tailed, and to exhibit mesokurtosis.

If a return distribution has negative excess kurtosis, it's said to be platykurtic, platykurtotic, or thin tailed, and to exhibit platykurtosis. 

If a return distribution has positive excess kurtosis, it's said to be leptokurtic, leptokurtotic, or fat tailed, and to exhibit leptokurtosis.

The key to recognizing excess kurtosis visually is comparing the thickness of the tails of both sides of the distribution relative to the tails of a normal distribution.

### Covariance and Correlation

Correlation affects diversification, which drives the risk of a portfolio of assets relative to the risks of the portfolio's constituent assets. 

Due to correlation, adding an asset on a stand-alone basis that exhibits a higher risk profile, can reduce the risk of an existing portfolio when added to that portfolio. 

- Covariance

The covariance of the return of two assets is a measure of the degree or tendency of two variables to move in relationship with each other.

  i) If two assets tend to move in same direction, they covary positively, and will have a positive covariance.
  
  ii) If two assets tend to move in opposite directions, they covary negatively, and will have a negative covariance.
  
  iii) If two assets move independently of each other, their covariance will be zero. 

Covariance is a statistical measure of the extent to which two variables move together, and not reported/interpreted on a stand-alone basis.

$$\text{Covariance} = \mathbb{E}[(R_i - \mu_i)(R_j - \mu_j)]$$

Can be estimated from a sample using:

$$\text{Cov}(R_i, R_j) = \sigma_{ij} = \frac{1}{(T-1)} \sum^T_{t=1} \left( [R_{it} - \bar{R}_i] [R_{jt} - \bar{R}_j] \right)$$
where $T$ is no. of time periods observed.

  i) When return deviations are in the same direction (i.e. same sign), the cross product is positive; 
  
  ii) When return deviations are in opposite directions (i.e. different signs), the cross product is negative 
  
When the cross products are summed, the resulting sum generates an indication of the overall tendency of the returns to move either in tandem or in opposition.

- Correlation Coefficient

measures the degree of association between two variables, but unlike the covariance, the correlation coefficient can be easily interpreted.

It takes the covariance and scales its value to be between +1 and −1 by dividing by the product of the standard deviations of the two variables.

  i) Correlation coefficient of −1 indicates the two assets move in the exact opposite direction and same proportion (i.e. perfect linear negative correlation). 
  
  ii) Correlation coefficient of +1 indicates the two assets move in the exact same direction and same proportion (i.e. perfect linear positive correlation). 
  
  iii) Correlation coefficient of zero indicates there is no linear association between the returns of the two assets.

Values between the two extremes of −1 and +1 indicate different degrees of association.

$$\rho_{ij} = \frac{\sigma_{ij}}{\sigma_i \sigma_j}$$

- The Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient

There are some useful measures of correlation in alternative investments that are based on the ranked size of the variables rather than the absolute size of the variables. 

The returns within a sample for each asset are ranked from highest to lowest.

The numerical ranks are then inserted into formulas that generate correlation coefficients that usually range between −1 and +1.

This is Spearman rank correlation coefficient.

The Spearman rank correlation is a correlation designed to adjust for outliers by measuring the relationship between variable ranks rather than variable values.

#### Example 1

Consider

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=2cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/2.5.3 Im22.png"}
\end{center}

=> Step 1: Replace actual returns with the rank of each asset's return. 
The ranks are computed by first ranking the returns of each asset separately, from highest (rank = 1) to lowest (rank = 3), while keeping the returns arrayed according to their time periods.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=2cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/2.5.3 Im23.png"}
\end{center}

=> Step 2: Compute $d_i$, the difference in the two ranks associated with time period i. 

The Spearman rank correlation ($\rho_s$), can be computed using those differences in ranks and the total number of time periods, n:

$$\rho_s = 1 - \frac{6 \times \sum_i d^2_i}{n(n^2 - 1)}$$

=> Step 3: Calculate $\rho_s$ (i.e. 0.5)

Rank correlation is preferred because of the way it handles the effects of outliers (extremely high or low data values).

Extremely high or very negative values of one or both of the variables in a particular sample can cause the computed Pearson correlation coefficient to be very near +1 or −1 based on the undue influence of the extreme observation on the computation, since deviations are squared as part of the computation.

By using ranks, the effects of outliers are lessened, and the resulting measure of the correlation using a sample is a better indicator of the true correlation that exists within the population. 

NB: Spearman rank correlation coefficient would be the same for any return that would generate the same rankings.

- The Correlation Coefficient and Diversification

The correlation coefficient is often used to demonstrate one of the most fundamental concepts of portfolio theory: the reduction in risk found by combining assets that are not perfectly positively correlated.

The below shows combining varying portions of assets A and B under three correlation conditions: perfect positive correlation, zero correlation, and perfect negative correlation.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=5cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/2.5.3 Im24.png"}
\end{center}

The highest possible correlation and least diversification potential is when the assets’ correlation coefficient is +1: perfect positive correlation.

The straight line to the lower right between points A and B plots the possible standard deviations and mean returns achievable by combining asset A and asset B under perfect positive correlation.

The line is straight, meaning that the portfolio risk is a weighted average of the individual risks.
That is, there are no benefits to diversification when perfectly correlated assets are combined. 

Diversification occurs when the risks of unusual returns of assets tend to cancel each other out. 

This does not happen in the case of perfect positive correlation, because the assets always move in the same direction and by the same proportion.

The greatest risk reduction occurs when the assets’ correlation coefficient is −1: perfect negative correlation. 

The two upper‐left line segments connecting points A and B plot the possible standard deviations and mean returns that would be achieved by combining asset A and B under perfect negative correlation. 

The line between A and B moves directly to the vertical axis (where standard deviation is zero). 

This illustrates ultimate diversification, therefore, combining the two assets into a portfolio results in rapid/total risk risk reduction. 

This zero‐risk portfolio illustrates the concept of a perfect two‐asset hedge and occurs when the weight of the investment in asset A is equal to the standard deviation of asset B divided by the sums of the standard deviations of A and B.

The risk that can be removed through diversification is called diversifiable, nonsystematic, unique, or idiosyncratic risk.

Assets that generate diversification benefits are shown to shift the attainable combinations of risk and return toward the benefit of the investor (i.e. less risk for same amount of return). 

Imperfect correlation leads to diversification that bends portfolio risk to the left, representing the improved investment opportunities afforded by diversification.

In the case of asset returns, true future correlations can only be estimated. 

Past estimated correlation coefficients not only are subject to estimation error but are also estimates of a moving target, since true correlations should be expected to change through time, as fundamental economic relationships change. 

Correlation coefficients tend to increase (i.e. offer less diversification across investments and asset classes) in times of market stress, just when an investor needs diversification the most.
