## SubTopic 5.5: Credit Risk and Credit Derivatives

### Risks of CDOs

- Risk from the Underlying Collateral

The risk of underlying collateral is the single greatest driver of risk associated with an investment in a CDO structure.

The CDO structure can also be used to engineer commodity price risk, private equity risk, hedge fund risk, and interest rate risk, such as risks inherent with unscheduled principal payments.

A CDO structure does not change the risk of the assets in the underlying portfolio.

Instead, the structure merely distributes the risks of collateral pool to the various tranche holders of the CDO. 

The risks of collateral portfolio change due to either changes in market conditions or changes in composition of the portfolio itself, and CDO investors bear the risk that the true nature of the collateral will differ from previously understood nature. 

The nature of actual portfolio stray from intended nature of portfolio. 

In times of stress, CDO managers are slow or reluctant to write down or write off poorly performing investments contained in CDO trust. 

The investor may need to perform an independent analysis to determine accurate values and risks of actual portfolio.

Default rates are a key driver of returns to collateral portfolios exposed to credit risk. 

Collateral portfolio value is driven by level of losses given default.

Low recovery rates combine with high default rates to generate high credit losses.

- Financial Engineering Risk

The massive losses beginning in 2008 on CDO investments that had highest possible credit rating (AAA) illustrate how wrong financially engineered products can go. 

Financial engineering involves powerful tools that generate enormous benefits. 

Financial engineering risk is potential loss attributable to securitization, structuring of cash flows, option exposures, and other applications of innovative financing devices.

The financial engineering of insured residential mortgages in the 1990s facilitated a cost‐effective supply of mortgage financing.

CMOs played an important role in facilitating efficient mortgage financing, developing more sophisticated and complex structuring of tranches. 

By 1994, the complexities of CMO structures had soared that many CMO tranches contained enormous interest‐rate‐related risks, even though the underlying collateral assets were virtually free of default risk. 

In 1994, a CMO crisis was triggered by rising interest rates; several large entities failed, and many others suffered enormous unanticipated losses. 

At the heart of the subprime debacle (in 2007) were mortgage loan borrowers with substantially greater default risk than prime‐grade borrowers.

Small banks and mortgage lenders made these loans and then sold them into pools that were eventually financed by mortgage‐backed securities (MBSs). 

Large investment banks purchased these MBSs and repackaged them yet again into a second pool, a CDO trust. 

The structures were used to slice and dice the risks of subprime MBSs. 

When the underlying subprime mortgages began to default at much faster rates than previously experienced, the whole financial structure collapsed, bringing down several major investment banks.

All market participants are directly or indirectly exposed to risks from use of financially engineered products. 

Therefore, market participants should be aware of financial engineering risk and participate directly in engineered products with care and concern.

- Correlation Risk

CDOs are called correlation products because the collateral pool of a CDO can reference numerous assets and because the correlations of the returns of those assets drive the aggregate risks of the portfolio. 

Higher correlation increases aggregate risk. 
Investors in a CDO are exposed to correlation risk.

The major risk of large losses comes from numerous defaults occurring at or near the same time. 

Thus, large losses occur when defaults are correlated.
If defaults are uncorrelated, then the risk is diversified, and default rates are steady. 

The safety of more senior tranches is maximized when correlation risk is minimized. 

The senior tranche holders do not want numerous defaults to occur at the same time such that all subordinated tranches are wiped out. 

Senior tranche holders want default risk diversified such that default losses do not reach the magnitude necessary to wipe out mezzanine tranches and more.

- Risk Shifting

Risk shifting is the process of altering the risk of an asset or a portfolio in a manner that differentially affects the risks and values of related securities and investors who own those securities. 

A potential conflict of interest exists between the issuer of CDO and investors in CDO tranches. 

The issuer has incentive to divest or otherwise place assets into collateral pool that contain worse credit quality than recognized by investors. 

The managers of the assets of a CDO take on increasing risk or greater risk than initially indicated.

Or, the manager may fail to take risk‐reducing actions when the risks of portfolio change due to market conditions. 

To reduce moral hazard, the equity tranche is held by issuer. 
The idea is that equity tranche holders are first in line to bear losses from asset defaults and have incentive to lessen default risks.

However, ownership of junior tranches can encourage risk taking.

- The Effects of Risk Shifting and Correlation on Tranches

It may appear that if higher‐risk assets are placed into collateral asset pool and/or if those assets are poorly diversified due to high return correlations, the higher risk will make all tranches less desirable.

However, risk shifting in CDOs has very different effects on different tranches. 

An equity tranche position in a CDO is viewed as a call option. 
As a call option, equity tranches, and to a lesser extent other highly subordinated tranches, can benefit from increases in risk of collateral pool.

The relations between level of risk of collateral assets of a CDO and the values of CDO's various tranches is interesting. 

Assume the risks of a CDO's assets can be altered substantially without having an immediate impact on the value of the assets. 

The sum of the values of all of the tranches, including equity tranche of a CDO, tend to equal the value of collateral pool. 

However, a large change in the risks of the assets (e.g. increase in WARF) has immediate effects on relative values of tranches. 

Increases in the risks of the CDO's assets transfer wealth from holders of more senior tranches to holders of less senior tranches.

Senior tranches become less valuable as volatility of CDO's assets rise (with asset values held constant). 

The senior tranches have less probability of being fully paid while coupons remain fixed. 

However, if the value of assets remains constant and if the value of senior tranches declines, then the value of junior tranches should rise. 

This effect is consistent with the structural model's view of equity as a call option and the result of option theory that call option values increase when volatility of underlying assets increases. 

The most junior tranche is viewed as a long call option on the collateral assets.

The most senior tranche is viewed as a long riskless bond and short an out‐of‐the‐money put option on collateral assets.

Higher volatility of the collateral pool helps the tranches that are long options (i.e. long vega) at the expense of tranches that are short options.

Higher risk in the collateral asset pool can occur both from higher‐risk assets and from higher return correlations among the assets (i.e. reduced diversification). 

A lower diversity score can shift wealth from senior tranches to junior tranches even when WARF is held constant. 

A very well diversified portfolio will generate a low but constant default rate. 

A low but constant default rate will spare senior tranches from losses, as all losses will be absorbed by junior tranches.

A very poorly diversified portfolio gives senior tranche holders an increased chance of losses (when assets experience very large losses) and junior tranche holders an increased chance of bearing few or no losses (when assets experience minimal losses).

- Other CDO Risks

The successful risk management of a CDO's portfolio requires understanding numerous potential risks. 

A risk due to difference in payment dates arises from mismatch between dates on which payments are received on underlying trust collateral and dates on which trust securities must be paid. 

This risk is compounded when payments on different assets are received with different frequencies, known as periodicity. 

This problem is solved through the use of a swap agreement with an outside party, in which the trust swaps the payments on underlying collateral in return for interest payments that are synchronized with those of trust securities.

A type of basis risk occurs when the index used for determination of interest earned on the CDO trust collateral is different from the index used to calculate the interest to be paid on the CDO trust securities. 

e.g. the interest paid on bank loans is calculated on SOFR plus a spread, but other assets are based on certificate of deposit rates in the United States. 

The risk here is when a mismatch occurs and the indices underlying cash income from the collateral assets differ from indices underlying payments to tranche holders.

CDO tranches suffer when collateral pool performs poorly. 
Collateral assets perform poorly for several reasons.

The market prices of collateral assets respond immediately to shifts in the levels, slope, or curvature of yield curve of riskless rates. 

Yield curve shifts can cause the value of collateral assets to change and can affect the cash flows available from reinvestment of cash flows from existing assets. 

Spread compression, when credit spreads decline or compress over time, reduces interest rate receipts from CDO's collateral and cause the CDO to face cash shortfalls even in the absence of defaults.

A steeply upward‐sloping yield curve can magnify the negative carry between the interest earned on the CDO's cash reserve accounts and the coupon rates of the CDO's tranches.

- Modeling Credit Risk in CDOs

In theory (such as CAPM), its argued that one should be able to calculate the beta of the CDO collateral portfolio and use that beta to estimate the beta of the various tranches. 

Credit risk displays a number of properties not shared by other sources of risk; thus, a different type of model is required. 

1) Default is a relatively rare event. 
Most corporations currently in existence have never defaulted. 
There are limited observations available with which to estimate various statistics through historical analysis. 

2) Many defaults occur due to systematic factors, rather than idiosyncratic factors.

3) Many financial institutions that invest in credit products are not able to hold diversified portfolios of credit products to eliminate the idiosyncratic risks of these securities. 

4) In some cases (e.g. sovereign debt), credit risk arise not just because of inability of counterparty to pay but also because of its unwillingness to do so.

The drivers of losses to a CDO of underlying credit risks are the default rate and loss rate given default.

The default rate refers to the percentage of collateral assets experiencing default. 

The loss rate given default is the percentage of defaulted security values that cannot be ultimately recovered.

The primary method for ascertaining the risks of tranches due to default risk in the CDO portfolio uses a copula approach.

A copula approach to analyzing the credit risk of a CDO is like a simulation analysis of the effects of possible default rates on the cash flows to the CDO's tranches and the values of the CDO's tranches. 

The idea behind the copula model of CDO default risk is that defaults are generated by two normally distributed factors: an idiosyncratic factor and a market factor. 

The idiosyncratic factor takes on a different value for each credit risk (i.e. bond) and generates hypothetical defaults whenever the factor's value for that particular bond is sufficiently high. 

The market factor is common to all credit risks in the CDO portfolio and reflects the tendency of defaults to occur in unison.

A parameter set by the user of the copula model determines the relative weights of the two factors (i.e. idiosyncratic versus market). 

Taken together, along with a user‐specified expected default rate, the model allows simulation of the probabilities of various default levels for the collateral pool.

The estimated probabilities of various default levels are then combined with a user‐supplied loss rate given default (i.e 1 – recovery rate) to estimate the probabilities of losses to each of the tranches in the CDO structure.

Rating agencies have used the copula model to estimate return distributions for CDO tranches involving credit risk, both corporate bonds and uninsured mortgages.

The copula model has been maligned as an important cause of credit crisis that began in 2007. 

The model was criticized for underestimating the risk of most senior mortgage tranches from mortgage defaults. 

There's debate as to whether the difficulties, including apparently erroneous credit ratings, were caused by misunderstandings of the model, misspecification of the model, or misestimation of the model's parameters.

CDOs and other structured products are very powerful tools for engineering risk and other attributes.

### Credit Enhancements

The measurement and analysis of credit risk are central aspects in the study of CDOs involving credit risk.

Understanding credit risk of the CDO's collateral portfolio is essential to understanding the risks of the tranches.

One widely used method of modifying the risk of various CDO tranches is to alter the securities in the collateral portfolio. 
Other methods fall under the category of credit enhancements. 
Most CDO structures contain some form of credit enhancement to ensure the majority of the securities issued to investors will receive an investment‐grade credit rating. 

These enhancements can be internal or external.
An internal credit enhancement is a mechanism that protects tranche investors and is made or exists within the CDO structure, such as a large cash position. 

Credit enhancements are made at expense of lower coupon rates paid on the CDO securities.

- Subordination

Subordination is the most common form of credit enhancement in a CDO transaction, and flows from the structure of the CDO trust. 

Its an internal credit enhancement. 
Subordination is the process of protecting a given security (i.e. tranche) by issuing other securities that has lower seniority to cash flows.

CDO trusts issue several classes or tranches of securities. 
The lower‐rated, or subordinated, tranches provide credit support for higher rated tranches.

The equity tranche in a CDO trust is the first‐loss position and provides credit enhancement for every class of CDO securities above it. 

Junior tranches of a CDO are rated lower than senior tranches; however, they receive a higher coupon rate commensurate with their subordinated status and therefore greater credit risk.

CDO structures are used for collateral assets with little or no credit risk, such as insured mortgages.

Subordination affects the timing of payments to various tranches rather than credit risk of those payments. 

In a traditional sequential‐pay CDO, the principal of senior tranches is paid in full before any principal is paid to junior tranches. 

This sequential payment structure is referred as a waterfall. 
As interest and principal payments are received from underlying collateral, they flow down the waterfall: first to senior tranches of CDO trust and then to lower‐rated tranches. 

Subordinated tranches must wait for sufficient interest and principal payments to flow down the tranche structure before they receive a payment.

- Overcollateralization

Overcollateralization refers to the excess of assets over a given liability or group of liabilities. 

Overcollateralization of a senior tranche occurs when there are subordinated tranches in a CDO. 

For example, a CDO trust with market value of collateral trust assets of R100 million issues three tranches: Tranche A is senior tranche and consists of R70 million of securities; Tranche B consists of R20 million of subordinated fixed‐income securities and is paid after the senior tranche is paid in full; there is a R10 million equity tranche with lowest seniority.

The level of overcollateralization is the ratio of assets available to meet an obligation to the size of the obligation and all other obligations senior to that obligation. 

The overcollateralization rate for the senior tranche is $\frac{R100}{R70} = 143\%$.
The denominator is the millions of dollars of value necessary to pay off that obligation, and any other obligation of equal or greater seniority.

The funds used to purchase the excess collateral come from both subordinated tranches, Tranche B plus equity tranche. 

The level of overcollateralization of Tranche B is $\frac{R100}{R90} = 111\%$.

The equity tranche provides the overcollateralization to Tranche B.
Overcollateralization is an internal credit enhancement.

- Spread Enhancement

Another internal enhancement is excess spread of loans contained in CDO collateral portfolio compared to the interest, or coupons, promised on the CDO tranche securities. 

The average coupon on the assets exceed the average coupon on the tranches such that in the absence of default, the CDO is able to receive more cash than required to distribute. 

This excess interest is retained and serve to enhance the credit‐worthiness of outstanding tranches.

The excess spread arise because the assets of the CDO trust earn a premium for illiquidity or because the assets are of lower credit quality than the CDO securities and yield a higher interest rate than rate paid on the CDO securities. 

A higher yield on the trust assets also result from a sloped term structure and mismatched assets and liabilities. 

This excess spread is used to cover losses associated with CDO portfolio. 

If there are no losses on the loan portfolio, the excess spread accrues to the equity tranche of the CLO trust.

- Cash Collateral or Reserve Account

A reserve account holds excess cash in highly rated instruments, such as U.S. Treasury securities, to provide security to debt holders of the CDO trust. 

Cash reserves are used in the initial phase of a cash flow transaction. 

During this phase, cash proceeds received by the trust from the sale of its securities are used to purchase the underlying collateral and fund the reserve account. 

Its argued that cash reserves are not the most efficient form of internal credit enhancement because they generally earn a lower rate of return than required to fund the CDO securities.

- External Credit Enhancement

An external credit enhancement is a protection to tranche investors thats provided by an outside third party, such as a form of insurance against defaults in the loan portfolio. 

This insurance is a straightforward insurance contract, the purchase of a put option by the CDO, or the negotiation of a CDS to protect the downside from any loan losses. 

The effect is to transfer the credit risks associated with the CDO trust collateral from the holders of the CDO trust securities to an outside company. 

These external credit enhancements from a third party guarantee timely payment of interest and principal on the CDO securities up to a specified amount and enhance the credit ratings of tranches.

### Credit Derivatives Markets

Derivatives are cost‐effective vehicles for transfer of risk, with values driven by an underlying asset. 

Credit derivatives transfer credit risk from one party to another such that both parties view themselves as having an improved position as a result of the derivative. 

Most credit derivative transactions transfer the risk of default from a buyer of credit protection to a seller of credit protection.

- Three Economic Roles of Credit Derivatives

The primary way that credit derivatives contribute to economy and its participants is by facilitating risk management in general and diversification in particular.

Consider the challenge faced by bank that established a long‐term relationship with a traditional operating firm.

The bank provides many services to its clients, including payment services and credit. 

If the client is very large, the credit risk exposure of bank to the firm through its loans become substantially relative to size of bank. 

The bank may wish to be sole direct creditor of firm for several reasons. 

The bank may view meeting all of client's loan needs as increasing the chances the bank will remain the firm's sole supplier of other services. 

The bank may wish to avoid potential conflicts of interest and legal complexities of making loans to a firm alongside other creditors.

As the sole creditor, the bank is better able to pursue its self‐interest. 

Credit derivatives provide the bank with a cost‐effective solution: 

  i) The bank can make large loans to the firm and transfer as much risk as bank desires to other market participants through credit derivatives.
  At the same time, other banks can transfer the credit risk of their portfolios to other market participants through credit derivatives. 
  Through this process, banks and other institutions are able to hold relatively well‐diversified portfolios of credit risks while maintaining efficient and effective relationships with key clients.

  ii) credit derivatives can provide liquidity to the market in times of credit stress.
  The availability and use of credit derivatives has soared in recent decades, resulting in credit risk gradually change from illiquid risk not considered suitable for trading to a risk traded like other sources of risk (e.g. equity, interest rates, and currencies).
  
  iii) highly liquid markets for credit derivatives provide ongoing and reliable price revelation.
  Price revelation, or price discovery, is the process of observing prices being used or offered by informed buyers and sellers. 
  Prices are mechanism through which values of resources are communicated in a large economy. 
  Ongoing and reliable price revelation regarding credit risk of major firms serves as a highly valuable tool for decision making and enhances overall economic efficiency.

- Three Groupings of Credit Derivatives

The following are three major methods for grouping credit derivatives:

  i) Single‐name vs multi‐name instrument
  
Single‐name credit derivatives transfer credit risk associated with a single entity. 

Most single‐name credit derivatives are credit default swaps (CDSs), which are most popular way to allow one party to buy credit protection from another party.

Multi‐name instruments, in contrast to single‐name instruments, make payoffs contingent on one or more credit events affecting two or more reference entities. 

Credit indices are examples of multiname credit instruments. 
CDSs on baskets of credit risk offer specified payouts based on specified numbers of defaults in underlying credit risks. 

In the most common form of a basket CDS, a first‐to‐default CDS, the protection seller compensates the buyer for losses associated with the first entity in the basket to default, after which the swap terminates and provides no further protection.

  ii) Unfunded vs funded instruments
  
Unfunded credit derivatives involve exchanges of payments that are tied to a notional amount, but the notional amount does not change hands until a default occurs. 

An unfunded credit derivative is similar to an interest rate swap in which there's no initial cash purchase of a promise to receive principal but rather an agreement to exchange future cash flows.

The most common unfunded credit derivative is the CDS.

Unfunded instruments can be for a single name or for multiple names.

Funded credit derivatives require cash outlays and create exposures similar to those gained from traditional investing in corporate bonds through the cash market. 

Credit‐linked notes are a common type of funded instrument.
They are thought of as riskless debt instrument with an embedded credit derivative.

  iii) Sovereign vs Non-sovereign entities
  
The reference entities of credit derivatives are sovereign nations or corporate entities. 

Credit derivatives on sovereign nations are more complex because their analysis has to consider not only the possible inability of the entity to meet its obligations but also the potential unwillingness of the nation to meet its obligations. 

The modeling of credit risk associated with sovereign risk involves political and macroeconomic risks that are normally not present in modeling corporate credit risk. 

The market for credit derivatives on sovereign nations is smaller than market for other credit derivatives.

- Stages of Credit Derivative Activity

The four stages in the evolution of credit derivatives activity:

  i) The first, or defensive, stage, was characterized by ad hoc attempts by banks to lay off some of their credit exposures.
  
  ii) The second stage was the emergence of an intermediated market in which dealers applied derivatives technology to the transfer of credit risk, and investors entered the market to seek exposure to credit risk.
  Another innovation during this phase was the synthetic securitization structure.
  Synthetic securitization represents the extension of credit derivatives to structured finance products, such as CDOs, in which CDOs take credit risks through selling CDSs rather than through purchasing bonds.
  
  iii) The third stage was maturing from a new product into one resembling other forms of derivatives.
  Major financial regulators issued guidance for the regulatory capital treatment of credit derivatives, and this guidance served to clarify the constraints under which the emerging market would operate.
  Dealers began warehousing risks and running hedged and diversified portfolios of credit derivatives. 
  During this stage, the market encountered a series of challenges, ranging from credit events associated with restructuring to renegotiation of emerging market debts.
  
  iv) The fourth stage centered on development of a liquid market. 
  With new ISDA credit derivative definitions in place in 2003, dealers began to trade according to standardized practices (e.g. standard settlement dates) that went beyond those adopted for other over‐the‐counter (OTC) derivatives.
  Substantial index trading began in 2004 and grew rapidly, and hedge funds entered the market on a large scale as both buyers and sellers.

The development of all these activities served to increase liquidity, price discovery, and efficiency in the market. 

And now legislation may require some credit derivatives to be exchange traded and backed by a clearinghouse.

This could take credit derivative activity into a fifth stage, from its OTC origins to the domain of the futures and derivatives exchanges.

- Five Key Risks of Credit Derivatives

Although credit derivatives offer investors alternative strategies to access credit‐risky assets, they come with specialized risks. 

These risks apply both to credit options and to credit swaps:

  i) Excessive Risk Taking - there's risk that traders or portfolio managers use CDSs to obtain excessive and imprudent leverage, either by design or by chance.
  Since these are off‐balance‐sheet contractual agreements, excessive credit exposures are achieved without appearing on an investor's balance sheet.
  As with all investments, proper accounting systems and other back office operations should be utilized.
  
  ii) Pricing Risk - OTC credit derivatives involve pricing risk, including risk from valuation subjectivity. 
  As derivative markets matured, the mathematical models used to price derivative contracts have become increasingly complex. 
  These models are dependent on assumptions regarding underlying economic parameters. 
  The pricing of credit derivatives is sensitive to assumptions of the models and the specification of the parameters. 
  Accounting and control procedures are hampered by the lack of market prices.
  
  iii) Liquidity Risk - Credit derivatives that are OTC contractual agreements between two parties can be illiquid. 
  A party to a custom‐tailored credit derivative contract may not be able to obtain the fair value of the contract in exiting the position.
  The legal documentation associated with a CDS prevents one party from selling its share of the CDS without the other party's consent. 
  For a standardized CDS, there are likely to be market makers providing liquidity.
  
  iv) Counterparty Risk - Most OTC credit derivatives contain counterparty risk. 
  Exchange‐traded derivatives are backed not only by parties on the other side of the contracts but also by institutions, such as brokerage firms and clearinghouses.

In the case of OTC options, there's only one side of a transaction that is at counterparty risk: the long position. 

The reason is that if the option writer defaults, the option becomes worthless. 

The credit protection buyer only suffers a counterparty loss when all three of following conditions occur: 
  1) the referenced entity experiences a credit event, 
  
  2) the counterparty to derivative defaults, and 
  
  3) there's insufficient collateral posted to cover the loss.

The reason the short side does not face counterparty risk is that once the option has been purchased, there's no loss to the option writer from the buyer's insolvency. 

However, in the case of a swap, both sides of the derivative can face counterparty risk. 

After a swap is initiated, its possible for market prices to move such that one side of the contract has a positive market value and the other side has a negative market value. 

The side with the positive market value clearly has counterparty risk. 

The side with the negative market value has counterparty risk to the extent its possible the market value become positive.

The primary counterparty risk created by a CDS is to the credit protection buyer. 

Losses to the credit protection buyer due to counterparty risk is manifested in two ways:

  1) if there's a credit event on the underlying credit risky asset that triggers the CDS and the credit protection seller defaults on its obligations to the credit protection buyer, then the credit protection buyer can lose the entire amount due under the CDS. 
  
  2) even if a trigger event has not occurred, the true value of the CDS to the credit protection buyer varies directly with the financial health of the credit protection seller. 
  This is because reduction in credit‐worthiness of the credit protection seller decreases the probability the seller will be able to fulfill its commitments to the buyer contained in the CDS.

The probability the credit protection seller will default at the same time the referenced asset of the CDS experiences a trigger event is relatively high if both events are driven by the same macroeconomic factors.

A major credit crisis can cause CDS trigger events at a time when both the seller experiences distress and the buyer most needs the protection.

Its ironic a credit protection buyer with a goal of reducing credit risk can introduce a new form of credit risk, known as counterparty risk, into a portfolio from the purchase of a CDS.

  v) Basis Risk - is risk due to imperfect correlation between the values of CDS and the asset being hedged by the protection buyer. 
  The protection buyer takes on basis risk to the extent that the reference entity specified in the CDS does not precisely match the asset being hedged. 
  A bank hedging a loan might buy protection on a bond issued by the borrower instead of negotiating a more customized, and less liquid, CDS linked directly to the loan.
  If the value of the loan and the value of the bond are not perfectly correlated, there is basis risk. 
  Another example is a bank using a CDS with a five‐year maturity to hedge a loan with four years to maturity.
  The reason for doing so is higher liquidity in CDSs with five years to maturity. 
  The protection buyer takes on basis risk to the extent that the four‐ and five‐year loan values experience different price movements.

\newpage

### Credit Default Swaps

A credit default swap (CDS) is an insurance‐like bilateral contract in which the buyer pays a periodic fee (analogous to insurance premium) to the seller in exchange for a contingent payment from the seller if a credit event occurs with respect to an underlying credit‐risky asset.

A CDS is negotiated on any variety of credit‐risky investments, primarily corporate bonds.

- Credit Default Swaps and Total Return Swaps

There are two primary types of swaps involving credit risk:

  i) the more predominant, CDS, is where credit protection buyer pays a periodic premium on a predetermined amount (notional amount) in exchange for a contingent payment from the credit protection seller if a specified credit event occurs.
  The credit protection buyer uses the payment to hedge losses suffered from the specified credit event. 
  The credit protection seller receives a periodic premium in exchange for delivering a contingent payment to the credit protection buyer if a specified credit event occurs.

Below, the credit protection buyer is assumed to hold a cash position in a credit‐risky asset and is using a CDS to purchase credit protection. 

The credit risk of the underlying risky asset is transferred from the credit protection buyer to the credit protection seller. 

The credit protection seller is interested in bearing the credit risk for the potential rewards or may hedge the credit risk away, using, for example, another credit derivative.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=3.5cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/5.5.4 Im98.png"}
\end{center}

A variation on the CDS is a total return swap with a credit‐risky reference asset.

  ii) In a total return swap, the credit protection buyer, the owner of the credit risky asset, passes on the total return of the asset to the credit protection seller in return for a certain payment.
  The credit protection buyer gives up the uncertain returns of the credit‐risky asset in return for a certain payment from the credit protection seller. 
  The credit protection seller now receives both the upside and downside of the return associated with credit‐risky asset. 
  The credit protection seller takes on all economic risk of the underlying asset, as if that asset were on the balance sheet or in the investment portfolio.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=3.5cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/5.5.4 Im99.png"}
\end{center}

In the case of a CDS, the credit protection buyer makes fixed payments, i.e. swap premium, to the credit protection seller. 

If the credit experiences a trigger event (e.g. a default), the credit protection buyer receives cash from the credit protection seller. 

In the case of a total return swap, the credit protection buyer makes payments to the credit protection seller based on the total market return of the underlying asset. 

The total market return is composed of any coupon payments and any change in the underlying bond's market price. 

The credit protection buyer receives a payment from the credit protection seller that vary with interest rates but does not vary based on the performance of the same credit risk.

CDSs and total return swaps on credit‐risky assets are used to transfer risk. 

CDSs are very flexible. 
For instance, a CDS may state in its contract the exact amount of insurance payment in the event of a credit event. 

Alternatively, a CDS is structured so that the amount of the swap payment by the credit protection seller is determined after the credit event. 

The payment by the credit protection seller in the event of a credit event is determined by the market value of the referenced asset after the credit event has occurred.

In total return swaps, there's no need to specify the events that lead to payments, since payments are driven by market values.

- Mechanics of a Credit Default Swap

The CDS market is contract driven. 
That is, each CDS is a privately negotiated transaction between the credit protection buyer and credit protection seller.

Fortunately, the ISDA, the primary industry body for derivatives documentation, has established standardized terms for CDSs. 

These terms are not mandated for use but are available to market participants and used as a framework for negotiating a deal. 

The standard ISDA agreement serves as a template to negotiated credit agreements that contains provisions commonly used by market participants. 

The standard ISDA agreement provides specifications relating to the following five aspects of the deal:

  i) CDS spread/premium - is paid by credit protection buyer to credit protection seller and is quoted in basis points per annum on the notional value of the CDS. 
  The CDS spread is not a credit yield spread but a price or rate quote for buying credit insurance. 
  The price of this credit insurance is paid quarterly by the protection buyer.
  
  ii) Contract size - ISDA does not impose any limits on size or length of term of a CDS; this is up to the negotiation of the parties involved. 
  
  iii) Trigger events - determine when the credit protection seller must make a payment to the credit protection buyer. 
  Both sides to a CDS negotiate these terms intensely. 
  The broader the definition of a trigger event, the more likely cash will flow from protection seller to protection buyer and the higher the appropriate spread will be. 
  The ISDA agreement provides for seven kinds of potential trigger events; the parties to a CDS are welcome to add more, although the events identified by ISDA cover all types of credit events: 
  
  1. Bankruptcy - A filing for bankruptcy is associated with a company's inability to pay its debt.
  
  2. Failure to pay - Although company not in bankruptcy yet, it is not able to meet its debt obligations as they come due.
  
  3. Restructuring - Any form of debt restructuring that's disadvantageous to a holder of referenced credit. 
  Restructuring is a fuzzy term, and ISDA clarifies this part of the standard contract by offering the following four options for the parties to consider: no restructuring, full restructuring, modified restructuring (which limits resulting obligations to bonds maturing in less than 30 months), and modified‐modified restructuring (which is less strict than modified restructuring because resulting bonds have maturities of up to 60 months).
  
  4. Obligation acceleration - All bond and loan covenants contain provisions that accelerate the repayment of loan or bond if the credit quality of the borrower begins to deteriorate due to a number of events, such as failure to pay, bankruptcy (which ISDA covers independently), or ratings downgrade.
  
  5. Obligation default - Any failure to meet a condition in the bond or loan covenant that'd put the borrower in breach of the covenant. 
  It'd be something like the failure to maintain a sufficient current ratio or a minimum interest earnings coverage ratio.
  
  6. Repudiation/moratorium - Associated with sovereign or emerging markets debt. 
  Its a refusal by sovereign government to repay its debt as it comes due or even an outright rejection of its debt obligations.
  
  7. Government intervention - A government's action or announcement reduces required payments or priority of making payments.
  
  iv) Settlement - If a credit event occurs, settlement is made either with a cash payment or physical settlement. 
  In a cash settlement, the credit protection seller makes the credit protection buyer whole by transferring to the buyer an amount of cash based on the contract.
  The settlement price is sometimes the present value of the contractual cash flows over its remaining life, or it is determined through auction processes.
  Cash settlement does not occur as frequently as one expects, because its difficult to agree on a good market‐based measure of loss.
  Most CDSs use physical settlement upon the occurrence of a credit event. 
  Under physical settlement, the credit protection seller purchases the impaired loan or bond from credit protection buyer at par value. 
  The credit‐risky asset is physically transferred to credit protection seller's balance sheet, and the face or par value of bond is transferred to protection buyer from protection seller.
  
  v) Delivery - Within particular limits, the credit protection buyer has a choice of assets to be delivered for physical settlement. 
  This raises the issue of which of those assets is cheapest to deliver. 
  The concept of multiple deliverable assets is common throughout derivatives and provides an option to the holder of the short option position that should be reflected in the contract's price or terms. 
  Deliverables include direct obligations of referenced entity, such as corporate bonds or bank loans; obligations of a subsidiary of referenced entity if the subsidiary is at least 50% owned by the referenced entity (referred as qualifying affiliate guarantees); and obligations of a third party that the referenced entity may have guaranteed (known as qualifying guarantees). 
  Physical settlement can create problems if there's an insufficient supply of assets to deliver, because the notional value of an outstanding CDS exceeds the principal value of the underlying bonds.

#### Example 1

Consider hypothetical transaction takes place between hedge fund as credit protection seller and commercial bank as credit protection buyer. 
The referenced entity is airline company (Firm).
The referenced asset is R20 million of face value debt.
The term of transaction is seven years. 
In exchange for protection provided over the next seven years, the Fund receives 2% of notional amount per year, payable quarterly. 
The contract is settled physically, meaning if credit event takes place, the Bank will deliver R20 million in face value of any qualifying senior unsecured paper issued by the Firm in return for a R20 million payment by the Fund.
The contract will be terminated, and no further payments will be made by the Bank. 
Assume default takes place after exactly three years. What cash flows and exchanges take place?

=>

Each quarter for 12 quarters, the Bank pays the Fund R100,000. 

This value is found by multiplying the notional amount (R20 million) by quarterly rate of 0.5% (i.e. 2%/4). 
When default occurs, the Bank delivers R20 million in face value of referenced bond to Fund in exchange for R20 million in cash.
The CDS terminates immediately after these exchanges.


Four major terms define a CDS:

  i) Credit reference - CDS contracts specify a referenced asset. 
  The referenced asset (referenced bond, referenced obligation, or referenced credit) is the underlying security on which the credit protection is provided.
  Following a credit event, particular qualifying bonds are deliverable.
  A senior unsecured bond is the reference entity, but bonds at other levels of the capital structure are referenced.
  
  ii) Notional amount - CDS contracts specify the amount of credit risk being transferred. 
  This amount, agreed on by both the protection buyer and the protection seller, is analogous to the principal value of a cash bond.
  
  iii) CDS spread - The annual payment rate, quoted in basis points.
  Payments are paid quarterly and accrue on actual/360‐day basis. 
  The spread is also called the fixed rate, coupon, premium, or price.
  
  iv) CDS maturity - CDS contracts expire on 20th of March, June, September, or December. 
  The five‐year contract is the most common and most liquid.

The economics of CDS in previous example is viewed from perspective of bank. 

Suppose the bank owned R20 million in face value of referenced credit (bond).

What yield would that bond be expected to offer relative to the riskless rate, given that a CDS was available at a spread of 2%?

The answer is the yield on risky debt must exceed the yield on riskless debt of similar maturity by approximately the same rate as CDS spread, 2%. 

Thus the bank earns 2% more than riskless rate (i.e. earns credit spread) by holding the risky bond, then lays off all that risk by paying a 2% CDS spread. 

The bank as a protection buyer hedges the credit risk and earns a return equal to riskless rate.

In practice, the CDS spread can differ from the yield spread due to factors such as the counterparty risk of the CDS.

- Valuing CDS Contracts

CDSs and other swaps are entered into without immediate cash payments from either side and are viewed as having near zero market values to each side at inception.

This is because the present value of expected premiums paid by CDS buyer is approximately equal to present value of expected payments to be made by CDS seller. 

As time passes, the risk of referenced asset may change, general credit conditions may change, and market prices and yields may change.

Thus, the value of a CDS is expected to change through time.

The process of altering the value of a CDS in the accounting and financial systems of the CDS parties is a mark‐to‐market adjustment.

Investors perform a mark‐to‐market (MTM) adjustment to the value of CDS contracts for three primary reasons: 

  i) financial reporting, 
  
  ii) realizing economic gains or losses, and 
  
  iii) managing collateral.

If the market premium moves wider than contract premium, a protection buyer experiences an MTM gain because protection was bought more cheaply than currently available in market. 

But if the market premium tightens, the protection seller experiences an MTM gain (and the protection buyer experiences an MTM loss). 

Calculating a CDS MTM adjustment is the same as calculating the cost of entering into an offsetting transaction.
