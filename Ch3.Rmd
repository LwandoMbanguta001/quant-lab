# Ch3: Futures

### Introduction

Futures contracts are standardised forward contracts, and they 
developed because forward contracts are difficult to reverse.

There's also a need for efficient price discovery which means liquidity needs to be enhanced, and this only comes about when activity in the market increases, and in pursuance of this contracts need to be standardised in terms of quality, quantity and expiry date. 

Once this need is satisfied, an exchange is an appropriate market form, and an exchange mitigates risk, which further enhances the breadth and depth of the market.

This does not mean all forward markets are destined to become futures markets. 

In some markets, reversibility of deals is not crucial and customisation in terms of quantity and expiry is required. 

For example, the outright forward forex market is where commercial transactions (importing and exporting) require customisation and rarely require reversal.

### Futures Defined

A futures contract is defined as a contractual obligation in terms of which one party to the deal undertakes on T+0 to sell an asset at a price (determined on T+0) on a future date, and the other party undertakes to buy the same asset at the same price on the same future date. 

The differences (to forward contracts) are that the contracts are standardised, the underlying assets are standardised, and the contracts are exchange-traded, because these qualities render the contracts marketable.

NB: futures are marketable in the sense that they can be “closed out” by undertaking an equal and opposite transaction.

Forward markets are OTC markets (mostly), whereas futures markets are all formalised in the form of financial exchanges, the members of which effect all trading, and the exchange guarantees all transactions by interposing itself between buyer and seller.

Thus, a future is a standardised contract which obligates the buyer to accept delivery of, and the seller to deliver, a 
standardised quantity and quality of an asset at a pre-specified price on a prestipulated date in the future.

\end{center}

At least one party to the contract must be a member of the exchange.

Even though a client may buy a future from, or sell a future to, a member of the exchange, the transaction is guaranteed by the exchange, i.e. the exchange acts as the seller for each buyer, and as the buyer for each seller: it interposes itself in each futures deal.

The futures market is a "zero sum game", i.e. for every buyer of a contract there's a seller.

Consequently, if a buyer makes a loss, the seller gains by same amount.

Though the future emphasisises delivery, its rare in practice, particularly in financial futures markets.

Participants in futures markets prefer settlement of profit or loss on expiry date.

NB: Delivery takes place only is a few financial and commodity futures contracts.

Every futures contract has a specific size, as opposed to a forward contract where size is negotiated between buyer and seller. 

A futures contract is a derivative instrument, i.e. it and its value are derived from an underlying asset and it cannot exist in the absence of this asset. 

The underlying assets of futures contracts are divided into two broad categories, i.e. specific assets and notional assets, and there are various subcategories under each, such as storable assets, perishable assets, income-producing assets, etc. 

Can categorise and sub-categorise futures broadly into:

1) Financial futures
  
  i) Interest rates
  
  ii) Shares/equities
  
  iii) Currencies
  
2) Commodity futures

  i) Agricultural
  
  ii) Metals and energy

Futures market participants are fixing a price now for settlement in the future, thus the price of the future is related to the price of the underlying instrument.

As the price of the underlying instrument varies, so does the price of the future (but not always to the same extent)

The price of the future at expiry time on the expiry date is equivalent to spot price. 

Thus futures price moves closer to spot price as time goes by (i.e. it converges on the spot price).

The contract trades (i.e it can be reversed = “closed out”) because it has a value, and this value is largely influenced by the spot price of the underlying asset, but also by expectations. 

Price is the only feature of future that varies and each contract has a minimum movement size or “tick size”.

It's a feature of futures markets that no money changes hands when a deal is struck. 

However, both buyer and seller are required to make a “good faith” deposit - termed the “margin”.
This deposit is made with the broker who, in turn, passes it on to the exchange.

### Futures Trading Price vs Spot Price

Buyers and sellers of futures contracts trade at market prices for relevant futures, i.e. at prices established in the market by the interplay of supply of and demand for the futures contracts.

These prices are different from spot prices of underlying assets, but the prices of futures are closely related to spot prices of underlying assets.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=4cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/SAIFM Exams/Derivatives Market/Images/Im25.png"}
\end{center}

The price of a future always converges upon the spot (cash market) price as the expiry date gets closer. 

This is because basis (i.e. similar to net carry cost) becomes smaller with passage of time. 
On expiry date, the basis (and net carry cost) is zero.

At times, the future can trade above and at discount to the spot price.
The difference between spot and market price is not consistent.

This is because expectations play a major role in the determination of futures price.

### Organisational Structure of Futures Markets

The futures market is primary market, while futures cannot be sold, they can be "closed out" at any time dealing in the opposite direction.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=4cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/SAIFM Exams/Derivatives Market/Images/Im26.png"}
\end{center}

The market form of futures market is formal in the shape of an exchange. 

With regards to trading driver and trading system, the futures market in South Africa is order and ATS (automated trading system), i.e. an order-matching method on an ATS is followed.

1) The broking members of the exchange register their clients with the exchange (this is unique as most futures exchanges do not know who the clients of the members are).

2) These members are broker-dealers, as they may deal as principals or agents and the capacity of trading is disclosed to the client. 
The broker-dealers at times deal in dual capacity in a single deal.

3) Some broker-dealers do not have clients and only deal as principals, and some broker-dealers deal only as agents with clients (both are called single capacity).

4) The ATS is constructed in such a way that broker-dealers input their orders into the system, and sellers do so too.
The system places on the screen the best buy and sell orders for all different contracts and has a drop-down facility where the non-best buy and sell orders appear (to show the depth of the market).

5) Because buyers and sellers are ultimately to deal with the exchange, identities of broker-dealers are not displayed.

6) When two opposite orders match, the deal is automatically 
consummated by ATS, and the two members are informed via the 
system. 
The clients (if applicable) are informed in turn by their broker-dealers.

7) A broker-dealer can deal in dual capacity, meaning a single order is split between principal and agent.

Because large deals may affect prices unduly, the Rules of the exchange allow for off-ATS trading. 

These deals are negotiated between members and then reported on the ATS, but most futures deals are done via the ATS.

In some futures markets, the open outcry floor method of trading is preferred. 

This is also an order driven trading system, which is highly transparent because the broker-dealers face each other in a “trading pit”, i.e. ensuring clients’ orders (and broker-dealers’ own orders) are transacted at the best prices. 

An ATS is seen as imitating the transparency of floor trading.

All deals are cleared through a clearing house (called JSE Clear) that is separate from the exchange. 

The clearing house is regarded as being responsible for the management of the market. 

The clearing house is backed by a Fidelity fund.

### Margining and Marking to Market

The Clearing House (CH) of the exchange becomes the buyer from every seller and the seller to every buyer the minute a trade matches on the trading platform.

This process is known as novation. 
As a result, the exchange now assumes the credit risk of each party that holds and open position, whether short or long.

The exchange uses two lines of defence to protect the exchange from potential loss through the default by the open position holder:

  i) Initial margin
  
The CH requires that for an open position, either long or short, to place a “good faith deposit’ known as an initial margin. 

It's usually 5-8% of the value of the contract and is sufficient to cover a single day loss on an open position.

The initial margin protects the exchange from default because it's extremely unlikely that losses on positions in a single day will exceed the initial margin.

When a position is closed out (a long position is sold or vice versa) or the contract reaches expiry, the initial margin is refunded to the client.
  
  ii) Variation margin

Each open position is marked-to-market at the end of each trading day and is based on daily settlement price. 

This generates a variation margin which is a cash payment to the CH from the losing position and payment to the winning position from the CH.

As a result of this daily process, futures trading is referred to as a ‘zero sum game’- the CH transfers variation margin from the loser to the winner. 

If an open position holder is unable to meet a variation margin call, the exchange will “close the member out”. 

That is, the exchange takes an offsetting contract and the loss is covered from the client’s initial margin

### Open Interest

This is the term for the number of outstanding contracts of a particular contract, i.e. number of contracts that are still open and obligated to delivery (physical or cash settlement). 

Double counting is avoided in the number. 

If broker-dealer A takes a position in a future and B takes the opposite position, open interest is equal to 1. 

When a contract is launched by an exchange, open interest is zero. 

As participants begin to trade, open interest rises, and this continues until maturity date approaches.

On maturity date, the future is “closed out” and open interest is again zero (because the contract is replaced with another that has a new maturity date).

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=4cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/SAIFM Exams/Derivatives Market/Images/Im27.png"}
\end{center}

### Cash Settlement vs Physical Settlement

In many commodities markets, physical settlement takes place, i.e. commodities that underlie futures contracts are delivered at expiry of the contract. 

In financial futures markets, physical delivery also takes place in some cases, but in most cases settlement takes place in the form of cash settlement.

Many traders in futures markets where delivery is required resort to trade reversing prior to expiry of the contract, because they do not want to deliver or receive the physical goods/metals etc.

These traders are involved in the market for speculative or hedging reasons and take an opposite position to the one they hold prior to maturity, in so doing liquidate their position at the clearing house.

### Payoff with Futures (Risk Profile)

The gains and losses on futures are symmetrical around the difference between the spot price on expiry of futures contract and futures price at which the contract was purchased. 

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=4cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/SAIFM Exams/Derivatives Market/Images/Im28.png"}
\end{center}

If the spot price on maturity is $SP_m$ and the purchase price is $PP$, then the payoff on a long position per 1 unit of asset is
$$SP_m - PP$$

The payoff in the case of a short future is,
$$PP - SP_m$$
The payoff on a future is a total payoff because nothing was paid for the contract (remember margin is a deposit that earns interest and is repayable in full).

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=4cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/SAIFM Exams/Derivatives Market/Images/Im29.png"}
\end{center}

### Pricing of Futures (Fair Value vs Trading)

All or some of the following factors influences the theoretical price of a future, called the fair value price (FVP):

  i) Current/spot price of underlying asset.
  
  ii) Financing (interest) costs involved.
  
  iii) Cash flows (income) generated by underlying asset.
  
  iv) Other costs such as storage and transport costs and insurance.

The theoretical price/FVP of a future is determined according to the cost-of-carry model (CCM).

The FVP is equal to spot price (SP) of underlying asset, plus the cost-of-carry (CC) of underlying asset to expiry of contract. 
Thus,

$$\text{FVP} = \text{SP} + \text{CC}$$
$$\text{CC} = \text{SP} \times ( \text{rfr} - I) \times t + \text{OC}$$
where rfr - risk free rate (i.e. financing cost for period); I - income earned during period (i.e. dividends or interest); t - days to expiry ($\frac{dte}{365}$); OC - other costs (i.e. transport, insurance and storage).

For financial futures,
$$\text{FVP} = \text{SP} + \text{CC}$$
$$\text{FVP} = \text{SP} + \text{SP} \times ( \text{rfr} - I) \times t$$
$$= \text{SP} \times \left( 1 + [\text{rfr}-I] \times t\right)$$

In the case of compound interest,
$$\text{FVP} = \text{SP} \times \left( 1 + [\text{rfr}-I] \right)^t$$

NB: Compounding makes little difference for short-term contracts.

In the case of short-term interest rate futures, theoretical price or fair value price (FVP) is determined from calculated forward-forward rate (also called implied forward rate).

NB: A basis point = 0.01% per annum.

The fair value is not equal to market value (= MTM value as determined by exchange). 

The forward-forward pricing of futures is the same as pricing of an FRA.

An FRA is seen as OTC equivalent of interest rate future. This calculation also applies to forward-forward foreign exchange swap.

The fair value price (FVP) of an individual bond future is,
$$A + B - C$$
where A - bond spot price (i.e. all-in price); B - carry cost (i.e. rfr); C - income.

Here,
$$B = A \times \left( \frac{\text{rfr}}{100} \times \frac{ \text{ftd} - \text{fvd}}{365} \right)$$
and
$$C = \frac{c}{2} \times \left(1 + \frac{\text{rfr}}{100} \times \frac{\text{ftd} - \text{cd}_2}{365} \right) \hspace{10pt} \text{if futures termination date crosses a books closed date and associated coupon date (i.e. not ex-interest)}$$
or
$$C = \frac{c}{2} \times \left(1 + \frac{\text{rfr}}{100} \times \frac{\text{cd}_2 - \text{ftd}}{365} \right)^{-1} \hspace{10pt} \text{if futures termination date crosses a books closed date but not associated coupon date (i.e. is ex-interest)}$$

A dividend future (DIVF) is used to hedge against dividend risk that accompanies a position in a single stock futures.

With commodities futures, insurance and storage costs are payable, i.e.
$$\text{FVP (per ton)} = SP + CC$$
$$= SP \times \left( 1 + [\text{rfr} \times t]\right) + SC \times dte$$

Currency futures are contracts for difference – CFDs, i.e. they are cash settled in ZAR with no delivery of principal foreign currency amount.

Retail and wholesale market participants use futures to speculate or hedge as there are no exchange control restrictions on currency futures trading.

Futures attract margin where cash flows only occur at maturity of forward exchange contracts.

The following can trade currency futures:

  i) South African individual - no limits applicable.
  
  ii) South African corporate entity - no limits applicable.
  
  iii) Non-resident individual or non-corporate entity - no limits applicable.
  
  iv) Resident FSP and collective investment scheme subject to their foreign portfolio allowance.
  
  v) Resident pension fund organisation subject to their foreign portfolio allowance.
  
  vi) Resident long/short-term insurer subject to their foreign portfolio allowance.
  
  vii) Hedge fund may trade in unlimited capacity provided they're not regulated under investment managers' rules.
  
  viii) Individuals have no limits to value traded in currency futures market.
  
A variation on "normal" currency future is the "Quanto currency future", e.g. a EUR/USD future contract is settled in ZAR at fixed rate.

This contract is useful for participants wanting exposure to underlying (EUR/USD exchange rate) but without exchange rate risk.

An "any day currency future" is where clients hedge exposure to specific date by selecting contract expiry date.

The benefits include:

  i) Effective and transparent edge against currency risk.
  
  ii) Hedge foreign portfolios precisely to a specific date.
  
  iii) Ability to swap futures for physical delivery through market participants.
  
  iv) Eliminates possibility of a client being over- or under-hedged.
  
  v) Eliminates necessity to buy-back or sell forward points as a result of being over- or under-hedged.
  
### Basis

As time in the life of a futures contract goes by, the futures price (FP) and fair value price of future (FVP) converge on the spot price (SP), and are equal on expiry date of future.

That is,
$$\text{FVP} = \text{SP} + \text{CC}$$
and basis (B), on the other hand, is
$$\text{B} = \text{SP} - \text{FP}$$
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=4cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/SAIFM Exams/Derivatives Market/Images/Im30.png"}
\end{center}

From above, FVP > SP when CC is positive (i.e. rfr > I on underlying asset).

When I > rfr (i.e. CC is negative), then FVP < SP.
Thus, when CC is negative, B is positive.

Basis is a number when a hedge is undertaken (i.e. buy underlying and sell future, or sell underlying and buy future).

If basis changes during life of hedge, risk (i.e. basis risk) emerges and the hedge will not be a perfect one, i.e. if basis strengthens/weakens, the outcome of hedge will be different from that hoped for/expected.

### Participants in Futures Market

Can be categorised as:

1) Members

  i) Clearing members - further split to broking and non-broking members.
  
  ii) Non-clearing members - further split to broking and non-broking members.

2) Non-members (deal only with members)

Clearing members are entities which:

  a) Enter into a clearing house agreement with the exchange.
  
  b) See to settlement of proprietary trading and client trading and those deals conducted by non-clearing members for whom it clears.
  
  c) Maintain and keep in force a suretyship in favour of clearing house by financial institution.
  
Broking members deal for their own account and/or for non-members, while non-broking members deal only for own account.

Non-clearing members are obliged to appoint a clearing member and settle all trades with their clearing member.

All members are required to abide by Rules of exchange, including:

  i) Fixed expenditure base (higher of 13 weeks' fixed expenditure or stipulated amount).
  
  ii) Capital adequacy
  
  iii) Bank accounts
  
  iv) Internal controls and risk management
  
  v) Minimum training
  
  vi) Minimum connectivity
  
Non-members are all participants in the market not involved in broking/dealing for others and are obliged to effect all futures transactions through broking members. 
These are:

  i) Foreign sector
  
  ii) Household sector (individuals)
  
  iii) Corporate sector
  
  iv) Financial intermediaries - which include banks, insurers, retirement funds and Collective investment schemes (CISs)

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=4cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/SAIFM Exams/Derivatives Market/Images/Im31.png"}
\end{center}

Can also classify participants in the futures market according to functionality:
  
  i) Investors
  
Investors in futures market are those participants that view the futures market as an alternative to the cash market (i.e. underlying market).

An investor may also use long-term instruments and short futures contracts to invest short-term or use short-term financial instruments and long futures contracts to invest long term.
  
  ii) Arbitrageurs
  
Arbitrageurs endeavour to profit from price differentials (mispricing) that may exist in different markets on similar securities.

Arbitrageurs play a significant role in the futures market by ensuring futures prices do not stray too far from fair value prices and by adding to the liquidity of the market.
  
  iii) Hedgers
  
Hedgers are participants that have exposures in cash markets and wish to reduce risk by taking the opposite positions in the futures markets. 

The opposite parties to hedgers are speculators that willingly take on risk to profit from their views in respect of future movement of prices/rates. 

Thus, hedgers transfer risk to speculators.
  
  iv) Speculators

Speculators are participants that endeavour to gain from price movements in futures market. 

Given the small outlay (i.e. margin) in comparison with cash markets (where full price is paid), speculators are attracted to futures markets because they can “gear up”.

Speculators and hedgers play a significant role in futures market in terms of enhancing the liquidity of this market. 

Hedgers endeavour to eliminate/reduce risk faced from holding inventories of financial instruments or commodities, while speculators assume the risk.

Thus, speculators willingly take on risks transferred to them by hedgers.

NB: There's no clear-cut distinction between membership of the exchange and functionality. 

### Hedging with Futures

Hedging is the transferring of risk from the hedger, who has a portfolio or who is awaiting a certain sum of cash, to some other party in the market, usually another hedger or speculator.

The hedger is concerned with price movements that may influence her existing portfolio, or a planned or anticipated portfolio.

Micro hedging is where each item in a balance sheet (liabilities and/or assets) is valued separately and an autonomous hedge set up for each item. 

Macro hedging is where the aggregate asset and/or liability portfolios are considered, and the overall risk is hedged in one operation.

A hedger has a certain hedging horizon, i.e. a certain date on which the hedge will end or have no horizon at all.

A hedge may be a long hedge or a short hedge, and may be anticipatory hedges (hedging a cash/spot position not yet taken) or cash hedges (hedging an existing position in the cash/spot market).

A hedge may also be a direct hedge or a cross hedge. 

A short hedge is where the hedger sells a futures contract. 

It's difficult to exactly match the cash market position with the futures hedge position undertaken, in terms of:

  i) Time horizon
  
  ii) Amount of asset/commodity
  
  iii) Characteristics of goods
  
Here, the hedger will attempt to match as closely as possible the characteristics of cash market asset with futures position; the hedge will be a cross hedge.

Hedgers wish to establish a hedge ratio (HR). 

This ratio establishes the number of futures contracts to buy/sell for a given position in the cash market.

$$\text{HR} = - \frac{\text{futures position}}{\text{cash market position}}$$
The hedger will undertake HR units of futures to establish the futures market hedge.

For example, if HR = -1, the hedger will have a matched long cash position and a short futures position.

### Basis Trading and Spread Trading

Basis (B) is either SP - FP or FP - SP.

Basis trading in futures market is a trading tactic consisting of the purchase of a security and sale of a futures contract with the same underlying security.

The motivation is that the speculator/arbitrageur is of the opinion that the two securities are mispriced with respect to each other, and that mispricing will correct itself at some stage in the near future, or that a profit will occur upon expiry of contract.

A successful basis-trade is where spot purchase price of a share (SP) plus cost of carry (CC), where SP + CC = FVP, is less than futures price (FP).
That is, basis number is larger than CC.

Here, the speculator/arbitrageur will buy the share (at SP), have it carried in the market at CC until expiry and sell corresponding futures contract.

Thus, the overvalued security (future) is sold and the correctly priced security is purchased.
This trade is called cash-and-carry trade.

A spread is the difference between the prices of two similar or related securities, and a spread trade has two legs, executed simultaneously as a unit (to avoid execution aka leg risk): the purchase of one security and sale of a similar or related security.

The result is a spread (a value), and the motivation is an expected change (narrowing or widening) in the spread over time. 

The speculator/arbitrageur hopes to profit not from changes in the prices of the legs directly, but from the narrowing or widening of the spread. 

The volatility in the spread will be lower than of the legs, thus lowering risk, but also lowering potential profit. 
This is reflected in lower margin requirements

There are two categories of spreads: 

  i) intra-market spreads - where a spread trade is undertaken in the same market but in different maturities of contracts.
  Also reffered as a calendar spread and intra-commodity spreads.
  
  ii) inter-market spreads - also called inter-commodity spreads.
  Is where a trade is undertaken in different but related 
assets.

Intra- and inter-commodity spreads are called commodity product spreads.

Selling the spread is the sale of distant contract 
and purchase of nearby contract. 

Buying the spread is the opposite, i.e. sale of nearby contract and purchase of distant contract.

Each member will carry its client’s losses if the client defaults just as each clearing member will carry its member’s (for whom it clears) losses if the member defaults.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=4cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/SAIFM Exams/Derivatives Market/Images/Im32.png"}
\end{center}

The risk the JSE bears is the risk that one of clearing members defaults, whether the result of a non-clearing member causing it to default or as a result of its own activities. 

This is remote, as clearing members are all major banks.
