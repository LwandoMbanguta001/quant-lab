## SubTopic 8.1: Funds of Funds

### Overview of Funds of Funds

- Four Functions of Fund of Funds Management

Delegated management using a fund of funds (FoF) approach provides investors with professional management to perform the following four important functions:

  i) Strategy and manager selection - The FoF manager is responsible for selecting the strategies and managers who will implement those strategies. 
  FoF managers have access to closed managers and insights regarding strategies that are likely to perform better going forward. 
  Many of largest institutional investors and their investment consultants have teams dedicated to finding, vetting, and investing directly in alternative investment funds.
  
  ii) Portfolio construction - Once the strategies and managers have been selected, the FoF manager has to decide on how much to allocate to each strategy and manager. 
  The allocation will depend on risk and return characteristics of individual managers and expected correlations between funds, and other fund features.
  
  iii) Risk management and monitoring - The FoF manager will monitor each fund to ensure its ongoing performance profile is consistent with fund’s overall objectives. 
  Some FoFs employ sophisticated risk‐management processes to monitor the underlying funds’ positions. 
  Other FoFs employ multifactor sensitivity analysis to gauge risk exposure to various market factors and analyze the funds’ potential tail risk.
  
  iv) Due diligence - For alternative fund investing, due diligence is the process of monitoring and reviewing management and operations of fund manager.
  This is one of important functions and value‐added features of FoF manager to consider when deciding between a direct and a delegated investment program.
  Some large FoFs are marred by blowups and fraud scandals, which caused some institutional investors to become wary about the value of an FoF’s due diligence process. 
  There's academic evidence justifying the payment of additional layer of fees in return for operational due diligence.
  Operational due diligence is the process of evaluating the policies, procedures, and internal controls of an asset management organization. 
  Net of fees, the largest FoFs outperform the smallest FoFs. 
  Larger FoFs outperform because their scale allows them to invest greater resources in due diligence and risk management processes.

- Eleven Benefits to Investing in Funds of Funds

In addition to accessing professional management for the four functions, there are a number of other benefits to investing in funds of funds:

  1) Diversification - Prudent investing dictates portfolios be well diversified. 
  Some investors lack necessary asset size and expertise to invest directly in funds to reach an appropriate level of diversification and risk reduction.
  Through a single FoF investment, investors can access a well‐diversified portfolio in terms of managers or strategies. 
  The diversification level of FoF portfolio is not necessarily a straightforward function of number of underlying funds or strategies analogous to stock investing. 
  Because funds are not single securities; they are previously diversified portfolios of securities.
  
  2) Accessibility - The median minimum investment for a single fund is R500,000, which makes diversification into numerous funds unaffordable for most individual investors.
  By comparison, minimum investment levels for FoFs are relatively low. 
  This allows more individual investors and small institutions to gain diversified access to funds though their capital base is comparatively small.
  
  3) Economies of scale - Investors share costs, such as those associated with manager selection, reporting, analysis, and due diligence processes, with their FoF co‐investors, thereby reducing their individual costs.
  
  4) Information advantage - As professional asset allocators, FoF managers have ability to access, collect, and interpret data gleaned from various channels, such as data providers, prime brokers, and industry contacts. 
  This gives informational advantage over nonprofessional investors.
  
  5) Liquidity (hedge funds of funds specifically) - Investments in hedge funds are illiquid, due to lockups, redemption gates, notice periods, and limited redemption dates.
  By comparison, liquidity terms offered by FoFs are more flexible.
  Most FoFs offer quarterly or monthly liquidity in normal market conditions. 
  Some FoFs offer daily liquidity, either through a listing on an exchange or via an over‐the‐counter secondary market that matches demand and supply.
  
  6) Access to certain managers - Access to best talent and ideas in alts community is a scarce resource.
  The most desirable funds are closed to new investments. 
  Many investors do not have necessary networks and protocol for obtaining investment capacity in these funds when it becomes available. 
  Investing in existing FoF that's already allocated to these desirable funds is fastest way to immediately participate in their performance.
  
  7) Negotiated fees - Due to their collective assets, some FoFs have successfully negotiated access to certain managers at reduced fees. 
  This is beyond the capabilities of most individual investors.
  
  8) Regulation - To facilitate their distribution to a wider audience, some FoFs choose to register in regulatory jurisdictions that offer better investor protection than their underlying investments, even though the cost and administrative and operational burdens are higher.
  The improved investor protections are reassuring for first‐time investors and ensure they will receive sufficient transparency, oversight, and quarterly reports.
  
  9) Currency hedging - Although the currency of choice in the alts world is the US dollar, some FoFs offer share classes denominated in various currencies with the currency risk hedged. 
  Institutional investors wish to manage their own currency risks, many small or private investors prefer to be shielded from currency fluctuations and delegate the hedging aspects to professional managers.
  
  10) Leverage - Some FoFs provide leverage to their investors. 
  They borrow money in addition to capital provided by their investors and invest it in a portfolio of funds. 
  This allows them to produce higher returns than would be produced with an unlevered FoF, as long as leverage and interest costs incurred are surpassed by unlevered returns of underlying fund portfolio.
  
  11) Educational role - Many first‐time alts investors look at FoFs not as investment vehicle but as a way of learning about hedge fund strategies and hedge fund managers. 
  Larger investors switch to direct investments in alts funds after gaining a few years of experience.
  
- Six Disadvantages to Investing in Funds of Funds

  1) Double layer of fees - FoF managers pass on to their investors all fees charged by underlying funds in their portfolios, while also charging an extra set of fees for their own work, and for an additional layer of service providers. 
  FoFs charge a 1% management fee and a 10% performance fee on top of an underlying fund management fee of sometimes 2% and an incentive fee of 20% for the funds.
  Due to economies of scale, institutional investors making large allocations have recently been paying much lower fees than the 1% and 10%.
  Fees are falling in some cases, due to both disappointing fund performance and increased buying power of large investors. 
  
  2) Performance fees not netted - In an FoF, the investor pays performance fees for each of underlying funds that are profitable, regardless of performance of overall portfolio. 
  If half the managers are down 10% and the other half are up 10% on a gross basis, the investor will have to pay a performance fee to the positive performers despite no positive returns at aggregate level. 
  The fees are the same for portfolios of funds using direct investing. 
  The fees are lower using a multistrategy fund because performance fees are charged on a netted or aggregate basis.
  
  3) Taxation - Because of their offshore registration, many funds and FoFs are tax inefficient for certain investors in certain countries. 
  
  4) Lack of transparency - Some FoF managers do not disclose the content of their portfolio or asset allocation. 
  They contend it represents the valuable skills they bring to the table, and are reluctant to reveal their full strategy.
  It becomes relatively difficult for their investors to understand what is really happening in terms of risk and returns beyond the information that is ascertained from the stream of net asset values (NAVs).
  
  5) Exposure to other investors’ cash flows - FoFs commingle the assets of a number of investors. 
  Investors are affected jointly by inflows and outflows, since co‐investors in the same fund trigger cash increases or decreases or undesirable leveraging to finance redemptions. 
  To satisfy investors’ requests for redemption, the FoF manager will sell the most liquid funds first, leading to a potential change in the FoF’s style.
  Custom portfolios for a single investor (managed accounts) are not exposed to this type of problem.
  
  6) Lack of control - In an FoF, investors give up control over how assets are managed.
  They lose the direct relationship with the funds in which the FoF invests. 
  Direct investment in funds allows investors to create allocations that fit their overall portfolios, but investors in FoFs can’t control this style allocation.
  
- Three Major Ways for FoF Managers to Add Value

One of the most important debates with respect to FoFs concerns whether they deserve their second layer of fees. 

In practice, there are three major ways for FoF managers to add value from portfolio selection and asset allocation:
  
  1) Through strategic allocations to various fund styles - Running an FoF is not a matter of assembling a large collection of good managers. 
  Having such collection can result in a concentration of risks, with somewhat illusory diversification if there is a high level of correlation in the trades or underlying exposures of these managers.
  The first choice an FoF manager make when organizing a portfolio is the long‐term strategic asset allocation. 
  The strategic allocation sets the long‐term weights across strategies, such as static weights of 20% on macro strategies and 30% on equity strategies.
  This implies analyzing long‐term risk and return profiles of different strategies, and examining the correlation of their observed and expected returns. 
  The goal is to determine an initial portfolio allocation consistent with fund’s long‐term objectives and constraints. 
  This task determines the long‐run beta of fund with respect to various sources of risks. 
  Superior strategic asset allocations is an important way for a fund of funds manager to add value.
  
  2) Through tactical allocations across fund styles - Tactical asset allocation refers to active strategies that seek to enhance short‐term portfolio performance by opportunistically shifting the asset allocation in response to changing environment. 
  Many FoFs argue they implement a top‐down, tactical allocation process.
  This involves making three key style‐weighting decisions periodically: 
  
  i) what to do (i.e. overweighting or underweighting a particular investment style); 
  
  ii) when to do it (i.e. implementing the changes based on levels of certain indicators or factors); and 
  
  iii) how much to do (i.e. deciding whether the overweight should be).
  
  In practice, an FoF’s tactical allocations are limited due to underlying funds’ liquidity constraints unless the fund of funds invests the most liquid areas of alternative investments or uses managed accounts. 
  New investment flows received by FoF are used to reallocate to the most attractive tactical opportunities.
  Tactical allocation is a way for fund of funds managers to add value by determining how much the FoF adjusts its asset allocations in response to changes in the market environment.

  3) Through selection of individual managers - FoF managers add value within a strategy through the decision of how much money to invest with each manager. 
  Although this manager selection activity seems very similar to a traditional stock selection activity, the reality is that FoF managers need to consider the liquidity of the funds. 
  Managers have to make a trade‐off between their ability to add value through dynamic manager allocations in highly liquid funds and the potential contribution of less liquid funds. 
  Managerial selection is a major source of added value for an FoF manager.

### Private Equity Funds of Funds

- Private Equity-Style Funds of Funds and Fees

Private equity-style funds of funds (PE FoFs) are investment vehicles, similar in legal structure to a PE-style fund, which make investments as limited partners in private investments and funds, as opposed to making direct investments into portfolio companies.

Many smaller institutions outsource their private fund investment program either through a dedicated account or by pooling assets with other investors. 

PE-style funds of funds, which are mainly organized by specialist asset managers, are vehicles that pool capital from a group of investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of private funds. 

Some funds of funds specialize in certain sectors or geographies, whereas others follow a more generalist approach.

PE-style funds of funds primarily invest in newly formed limited partnerships. 

Because of blind pool nature of such investments, where investors don't know the underlying portfolio companies before committing capital, the initial assessment and ongoing monitoring of fund management team's skills are key.

PE-style funds of funds also co‐invest alongside primary investors. 

This activity requires direct investment experience and skills. 

PE-style funds of funds also use secondary investments in existing funds or portfolios of direct investments. 

This is a niche activity for most funds of funds. 
This activity requires both co‐investment skills for assessment of companies already in the portfolio and primary investment skills for blind‐pool part of the transaction.

While investment in a particular PE-style fund has a blind‐pool nature, a fund of funds has established relationships with fund managers via existing investments. 

Its future portfolio is somewhat predictable and not necessarily a blind pool investment.

A newly created portfolio is likely to be largely composed of follow‐on funds raised by these known managers. 

Funds of funds are marketed on either a partially blind or a fully informed basis.

For a partially blind pool, some of intended partnership groups are identified, while for a fully informed pool, virtually all of intended partnerships are identified.

FoFs are seen as less efficient than single GP PE funds (i.e. direct fund investments) because of the additional layer of management fees and incentive fees. 

This double layer of fees is one of the main disadvantages of this structure. 

Given the resources required for institutional investor to select, monitor, and manage a portfolio of PE funds internally, investing through a fund‐of‐funds structure proves more cost‐efficient than a direct fund investing approach.

The cost of outsourcing investment management, including carried interest of funds of funds, is compared to performance‐related incentives, if any, paid in a program managed internally. 

Whether an in‐house program can work effectively without investment‐performance‐related incentives is debatable.

The annual costs of an in‐house team is substantial compared to that of a fund of funds.

- Private Equity Funds of Funds and the Value of Information and Control

Information is a valuable asset in an opaque environment such as PE.

Funds of funds provide the necessary resources and address the information gap for inexperienced PE investors through their expertise in due diligence, monitoring, and restructuring. 

Successful investing in PE funds requires: 

  1) a wide‐reaching network of contacts in order to gain access to high‐quality funds, 
  
  2) well‐trained investment judgment, and 
  
  3) the ability to assemble balanced portfolios.

An institutional investor taking the fund‐of‐funds route (as opposed to direct investment route) can lose access to information and control, essentially a cost in itself.

Because PE programs follow a learning curve, inexperienced institutions initially have little option other than to go through a fund‐of‐funds vehicle. 

Experience with funds‐of‐funds approach allow institutional investors new to PE to build knowledge and sophistication, leading to building their own portfolios of funds.

Funds of funds are used as a first step into PE and worth the additional layer of fees in exchange for avoiding expensive learning‐curve mistakes and for providing access to a broader selection of funds.

- Private Equity Funds of Funds, Diversification, and Intermediation

PE FoFs add value in several respects, especially in the case of investments in new technologies, new teams, or emerging markets. 

A fund of funds approach allows for reasonable downside protection through greater diversification than many investors achieve through a direct program. 

Its important to diversify a PE investment program across vintage years, GPs, industry, stage of investment, and geography.

For larger institutions, investments in PE funds and VC funds are too cost‐intensive when the size of such investments is small compared to administrative expenses.

A fund of funds mediate these potential size issues by either scaling up through pooling of commitments of smaller investors and providing each of them with sufficient diversification, or scaling down through sharing administrative expenses and making such investments less cost‐intensive by allowing larger commitment to the fund of funds.

- Private Equity Funds of Funds, Access, Selection Skills, and Expertise

Some limited partners, especially those new to private equity, may not be able to access the most popular and successful PE funds.

Depending on overall market situation, access to quality funds is highly competitive, and being a newcomer to the market pose a significant barrier.

Funds of funds are continuously involved in the PE space, speak the language, and understand the trade‐offs in the industry. 

PE FoFs offer those investors the advantage of being able to invest in top‐performing funds, either by having access to successful invitation‐only funds or by identifying future stars among young and lesser‐known funds. 

PE FoFs offer better access to top fund managers because those top managers welcome funds‐of‐funds investors as a more stable and experienced source of pooled capital.

Liquidity management is quite challenging, because it demands a full‐time team with insight and an industry network, adequate resources, and access to research databases and models, and skills and experience in due diligence, negotiation, and contract structuring.

### Private Equity Funds of Funds Investment Process

- PE Funds of Funds Have Varying Investment Objectives

There are many commonalities among PE FoFs. 
They offer investors diversified access to private equity, they aim to value‐add by selecting top quartile PE funds, and they potentially offer investors economics of scale and allocations to oversubscribed PE funds. 

Not all PE funds of funds are the same. 
They differ by three key dimensions:

  i) Geographical focus - Like direct PE fund investments, PE FoFs focus on country, regional, or global portfolio companies. 
  The preferred option depends on the size of the market opportunity. 
  PE FoFs seek to identify emerging PE funds to invest in before they become highly sought after.
  This requires strong domain knowledge, local presence, and sufficient scale to be treated by PE funds as a preferred investor. 
  There are also PE FoFs with a global focus. 
  These are fewer, and normally part of a larger organization with a global footprint to provide the right market expertise and access to the best GPs.
  
  ii) Focus - PE FoFs focus on different types of GP categories such as venture capital, growth equity, or buyouts.
  Within buyouts there are subcategories such as small, medium, large, and mega buyouts, depending on deal size. 
  PE FoFs focus on a specific category and subcategories, or diversify across categories.
  
  iii) Portfolio construction - When constructing a portfolio of PE funds, diversification is achieved in several dimensions, including different strategies, GP, vintage year, industry, and geography. 
  A right balance of diversification can reduce risk and enhance returns. 
  Concentrating on two dimensions – number of fund commitments per year and number of vintage years – can effectively reduce the loss of invested capital to zero and increase the average performance of a PE fund portfolio. 
  20 to 25 PE funds is the optimal size for a portfolio of PE funds thats diversified across stages, vintages, and geographies.
  Once an optimal point is reached, adding more funds has a negligible impact on risk reduction and reduce the value added from manager selection.

- Distinguish between Primary and Secondary PE Fund of Funds

PE FoFs are broadly categorized into the following strategies:

  i) Primary Funds of Funds - invest in individual PE funds at their inception through primary capital commitments. 
  Depending on its strategy, a primary FoF develop a portfolio of between 20 to 50 PE fund investments over several vintage years.
  Primary FoFs provide investors with exposure to diversified portfolio of PE funds and demonstrate a similar J‐Curve to that of individual PE fund. 
  As a mature category of PE asset class, many primary FoFs employ specific strategies and focus on investing in PE funds of a specific region, strategy or fund size.
  
  ii) Secondary Fund of Funds - invest in individual PE funds by acquiring LP interests through a secondary market purchase.
  Depending on its strategy, a secondary FoF develop a portfolio of several hundred LP interests and is significantly more diversified than primary FoFs. 
  Secondary FoFs provide investors with exposure to a seasoned and diversified portfolio of PE funds and demonstrate a shorter J‐Curve than an individual PE fund. 
  Given that many of purchased funds have progressed beyond their initial vintage year, LPs have visibility into portfolio companies held in the underlying funds.

- Describe the Process for Constructing a Portfolio of PE Funds

A process of constructing a portfolio of PE funds can be described in three phases:

  i) Portfolio construction phase - An investor must first decide how many PE funds provide adequate diversification. 
  The number of PE funds for a PE FoFs is between 15 and 50. 
  Next, the investor must ensure consistent investment through the cycle. 
  This means spreading the investment across vintage years. 
  The total number of PE funds and the spread across vintage years help investor decide on suitable size of their annual commitment. 
  After deciding on the amount to commit, the investor use top‐down criteria to structure the portfolio. 
  
  ii) GP and fund selection phase - This phase is screening GPs or funds. 
  Most investors adopt a mix of quantitative and qualitative screens based on their portfolio construction parameters that broadly includes categories and geography. 
  Investors also include specific parameters based on their preference or risk management. 
  Some larger institutional investors avoid first‐time funds because of their lack of track record. 
  Investors do not want to take an overly disproportional size of the fund, so the fund size must match their target commitment size. 
  Investors also make a qualitative assessment of GPs' reputation, strategy, team, track record, network, and risk management.
  While investor could screen for GPs, looking for top‐quartile GPs based on their historical performance, these GPs may not be fundraising. 
  The fundraising cycle for GPs is one fund every two to three years for small GPs, and one fund a year for large GPs with multiple funds strategy. 
  Nonetheless, the investor could be introduced to the manager and aim to get on the GP’s pre‐marketing list when they are next fundraising. 
  Alternatively, an investor may form a macro view and identify attractive areas for investment. 
  They would then screen for funds that meet that investment strategy, geography, or niche. 
  Its also important for investors not to rely solely on past performance due to the trend of declining performance persistence. 
  Investors also consider including emerging managers as part of their selection process.
  
  iii) Ongoing monitoring phase - After the closing of investment into PE funds, some of key activities for investor include:
  
  (1) Regular interaction with GP to understand the status of underlying portfolio companies and GP’s outlook on risks and opportunities.
  
  (2) Regular performance analysis of fund
  
  (3) Regular valuation update of the fund
  
  Some investors sit on the LP advisory board to monitor potential conflict of interest between the fund and GP.
  Most LP would attend annual LP meeting to get the update on the PE fund. The information from these activities help investor to refine their portfolio construction as market condition changes.
  
  An investor choosing the PE FoF option rely on manager of PE FoF to perform portfolio construction required to build a diversified portfolio. 
  
  Investors evaluate the manager of PE FoFs manager to determine whether the manager is able to select and access top quartile GPs for their fund.

### Private Equity Funds of Funds Investment

- Four Benefits to Investing in PE Fund of Funds

1) Diversification benefits - PE FoFs invest across PE funds and vintage years. 
This has the effect of reducing performance dispersion compared to investing in a single PE fund. 
It also lowers downside risk when compared to investing in a single PE fund.

2) Professional Management - The manager of PE FoF has a dedicated investment team with experience in identifying top‐performing PE funds. 
They have a network in the PE space they are targeting, either through staff with experience working in PE funds, or personal networks developed over time. 
This helps them identify GPs and conduct reference checks. 
FoFs invest in funds on a large scale, giving them economies of scale not available to smaller investors, and have a long‐term horizon and targeted pool of capital.

3) Access to funds, specific strategy, or geography - Many PE FoFs are specialized funds focusing on a particular strategy. 
They also focus on a specific geography.
The expertise and domain knowledge of the manager is difficult to replicate by smaller LPs without the help of external advisors. 
Some of the FoFs have established relationships with leading venture capital firms that are heavily sought after. 
These FoFs are able to provide investors access to these leading venture capital firms.

4) Lower capital commitment - The minimum investment for a single PE fund is R1m, thus an investor may need a large amount of capital to create a portfolio of PE funds. 
In comparison, the minimum investment for PE FoFs is lower and the investor can obtain the diversification without a large capital commitment. 
Some investors may not meet the minimum investment requirement for PE funds. 
But by investing through PE FoFs, they enjoy the economies of scale and gain access to PE funds they otherwise would be unable to.

- Four Disadvantages in Investing in PE Fund of Funds

1) Additional layer of fees - PE FoFs charge management fee and carried interest in addition to the layer of the fees charged by underlying PE funds. 
The management fee is 0.5% to 1.0% of committed capital with carried interest of 5% to 10% of realized gains, which reduce the returns the investor would've earned by directly investing in the portfolio of PE funds.
For large institutional LPs who have experience, bargaining power, and access to PE funds, the fund selection and risk reduction benefits of PE FoFs is significantly reduced. 
For smaller institutional LPs, they find that the cost of investing in a PE FoF is lower than if they had built an internal team to identify and monitor a portfolio of PE managers.

2) GP relationship remains with manager of PE FoF - The manager of PE FoF has direct relationships with underlying GPs as they are sourcing and evaluating the managers in their portfolio. 
Investors of PE FoFs do not have direct access to underlying fund managers without an introduction from manager of PE FoF.

3) Less transparency - Since PE FoFs are investing across funds, the information on underlying portfolio companies is limited. 
Investors in PE funds are able to obtain more detailed information on portfolio companies held in underlying funds.

4) Lack of liquidity - The PE fund has a fund life of 7 to 10 years. 
PE FoFs, or primary FoFs, have longer fund life than PE funds because they are investing in the PE funds across vintage years. 
In contrast, secondary FoFs have shorter fund lives than primary FoFs. 
The majority of PE FoFs are closed‐ended with finite fund life. 
This matches the underlying PE funds, which are likely to be closed‐ended as well.
There are some open‐ended PE FoFs, likely to have redemption features to provide limited liquidity on a quarterly or monthly basis.
But the redemption features come at a cost in the form or redemption penalty, or cash drag on returns as the FoF hold cash balance to meet redemptions. 
Most open‐ended funds have some gating mechanism such as a cap on total redemption to protect the fund. 
The liquidity from open‐ended fund is limited in times of market turmoil. 
Secondary market for PE FoFs stake may not be active, which makes exiting before the end of fund life challenging.
