## SubTopic 3.2: Commodities

### Investing in Commodities without Futures

Other popular methods of obtaining exposure to commodity returns: direct physical commodity ownership, equity‐related commodity investments, exchange‐traded funds (or notes), and commodity‐linked notes.

- Three Disadvantages of Direct Investment in Physical Commodities

Institutional investors obtain exposure to commodities through derivative contracts rather than through physical inventories for several reasons: 

  1) to avoid storage costs and other disadvantages of moving, maintaining, and managing inventories; 
  
  2) to avoid wasting the convenience yield implicit in physical inventories; and 
  
  3) to avoid the opportunity cost of capital or financing costs of purchasing physical inventories. 

- Hotelling's Theory and Attractive Direct Commodity Returns

The two hypotheses propose distinct views on direct commodity investments: 

  1) expected long‐run returns of direct commodity investment are attractive, or
  
  2) they are unattractive.

Hotelling's theory states that prices of exhaustible commodities should increase by prevailing nominal interest rate, perhaps with a risk premium.

Ignoring storage costs, expected spot prices of commodity i at a horizon point of T years, $\mathbb{E}[P_{i,T}]$, should be equal to the future value of the current spot price compounded at the nominal riskless rate plus a risk premium 
$$\mathbb{E}[P_{i,T}] = P_{i,0}e^{rT}$$
where $r$ - risk‐adjusted continuously compounded return required for holding commodity i for T years. 

In theory, it's conceivable that $r$ for a particular commodity could be less than default‐free nominal interest rate if there were inflation risk‐reducing or systematic risk‐reducing attributes of the particular commodity that were perceived by the marginal investor to be so attractive as to justify investment with a negative risk premium.

Generally, the spot commodity prices are expected grow at a rate equal to an appropriately risk‐adjusted nominal rate.

- Simon and Unattractive Direct Commodity Returns

Long‐run expected spot prices of commodities (in real or inflation‐adjusted terms) can be consistently less than predicted by Hotelling's theory
$$\mathbb{E}[P_{i,T}] \le P_{i,0}e^{rT}$$
The above views Hotelling's theory as ignoring technological changes.

It uses an inequality to set only an upper bound on expected spot prices. 

If the current price, $P_{i,T}$, is such that the left side exceeds the right side, arbitrageurs could purchase commodities and hold them, with the expectation of selling them at time T at a price that offers a superior expected return.

However, restrictions and frictions on short‐selling do not allow arbitrage in the other direction. 

Models that allow technological innovation predict that commodities can have expected spot prices that are lower than those predicted by Hotelling's theory, making direct investment in physical inventories unattractive in the absence of benefits derived from convenience yield.

- The Idiosyncratic Risks and Two Betas of Commodity‐Related Equities

Another way to gain exposure to commodities is owning securities of firms that derive substantial part of revenues from sale of physical commodities.

A problem is that most firms have revenues related to a variety of commodities or have operations that extend outside activities directly related to ownership and extraction of commodities.

As a result, share price of most firms will be poorly correlated with price of single commodity.

There are reasons why a firm focused on a single commodity might not be a good proxy for direct investment in firm's underlying commodity:

  i) high correlation between stock price and commodity price assumes firm has not hedged its exposure to commodity through short positions in forward or futures contracts. 
  
  ii) firm must own underlying commodities (or rights) rather than purchasing commodities or leasing rights at market prices.

Although earnings per share (EPS) of commodity‐producing firm may be somewhat highly correlated to the price of the underlying commodity, price‐to‐earnings (P/E) ratio may not be.

If stock market declines quickly, P/E ratios tend to fall throughout various sectors. 

When commodity prices and inflation are increasing, the decline in overall market P/E ratios could lead to decline in P/E ratio and prices of commodity‐producing firms.

Commodity equities may be viewed as having two betas: 

  i) to underlying commodity market and 
  
  ii) to the equity market.

Commodity‐related equities may generate returns uncorrelated with the price of the commodity that the firm produces due to idiosyncratic risk.

- Commodity‐Linked Exchange‐Traded Funds and Notes

There are several structures through which commodity ETFs can obtain exposure to commodity prices: futures markets, equity markets, and physical ownership.

ETFs based purely on physical commodities invest in a single commodity, such as gold or silver.

These investors hold a share of a physical stock of bullion held in a secure warehouse.

Most ETFs offer direct, unleveraged exposures, and some offer leveraged returns and others offer bear exposures (exposures negatively correlated with commodity prices by holding short positions in futures contracts).

Most ETFs are cost‐effective for retail investors but not cost‐effective for institutional‐sized portfolios.

Whereas investors in ETFs have a direct claim on an underlying pooled portfolio, investors in Exchange‐traded notes (ETNs) purchase a debt security with cash flows that are directly linked to the value of a portfolio. 

This debt security is issued by an investment/commercial bank that agrees to pay interest and principal on the debt at rate tied to the change in price of a referenced portfolio (or index). 

ETNs incur credit risk of issuing bank (i.e. counterparty risk), whereas ETF investments do not. 

In a falling equity market, equity‐based commodity ETFs can decline in value, even if prices of commodities are rising in the spot or futures markets.

- Three Advantages and One Disadvantage of Commodity‐Linked Notes

A commodity‐linked note (CLN) is an intermediate‐term debt instrument whose value at maturity is a function of the value of an underlying commodity or basket of commodities. 

CLNs are structured products created so commodity risk exposures are generated through positions in commodity derivatives.

CLNs are issued by large banks to meet risk and return preferences of investors; they can also be issued by firms that produce the commodities as a source of financing. 

CLN returns and prices can be closely linked to commodity prices.

Advantage to CLNs is that a commodity‐producing issuer of a CLN can benefit by better matching the risks of its assets and liabilities.

CLNs has advantages to investors:

  i) An investor does not have to execute the rolling of commodity futures contracts to maintain exposure. 
  If CLN uses futures contracts to obtain its commodity exposure, the mechanics of rolling the positions becomes the problem of the issuer of the note (who must roll futures contracts to hedge the commodity exposure embedded in the note). 
  
  ii) The note is a debt instrument. 
  Although some institutional investors have investment restrictions on direct positions in futures contracts (due to their implicit leverage and potentially large losses), they may be able to obtain commodity exposure through CLNs because they are debt instruments. 

A disadvantage of CLNs is that they contain the idiosyncratic default risk of the issuing firm.

#### Example 1

A plain‐vanilla note from particular issuer carries coupon rate of 7%. 
The firm issues CLN with coupon of 4%. 
The CLN contains an implicit call option on S&P GSCI (currently at 1,500) with strike price set 10% out‐of‐the‐money, at 1,650.
How much would CLN distribute as principal payment on R1,000,000 note under following scenarios: The S&P GSCI value at notes maturity is: 1,500, 1,600, or 1,700?

=>

 $\text{GSCI}_X$ = 1,650 is strike price for call option embedded in the note.

  i) For $\text{GSCI}_T$ = 1,500 and 1,600 the implicit call option finishes out of the money. 
Thus
$$\left([1 + \max\left(0, \frac{\text{GSCI}_T - \text{GSCI}_X}{\text{GSCI}_X}\right)] \times R1,000,000\right) = R1,000,000$$

  ii) For $\text{GSCI}_T$ = 1,700
$$\left([1 + \max\left(0, \frac{\text{GSCI}_T - \text{GSCI}_X}{\text{GSCI}_X}\right)] \times R1,000,000\right) = R1,030,303$$  

Not all CLNs are principal protected.
Some notes have principal payments that share fully the change in value of commodity price changes.

The value of the principal owed at maturity can be either higher or lower than the note's face value. 

This is viewed as a CLN linked to a futures contract instead of an option contract.

Coupons are linked to the commodity price or commodity index as well as to the principal.

### The Term Structure of Forward Prices on Commodities

The slope and shape of forward curve for certain commodities depend on three factors: market interest rates, storage costs, and convenience yield. 

- Costs of Carry for Commodities

The forward price of a commodity $(F_T)$ is based on carrying costs and the spot price of the commodity as 
$$F_T \le P_0 e^{(r+c-y)T}$$

Cost‐of‐carry models assume in an informationally efficient market, when two positions converge to an equivalent value at some point in the future, any differences in their current prices will be determined exactly by the differences in their carrying costs.

In perishable commodities, spoilage costs are modelled separately as cost of carry or included as storage cost. 

Spoilage cost is loss of value that naturally occur through time during storage due to physical deterioration. 

Inventory shrinkage is loss of inventory through time due to theft, decline in moisture content, and so forth.

Cost‐of‐carry model indicates a maximum forward price.

When arbitrageurs cannot borrow a commodity without incurring expenses (other than time value of money), it's possible that forward prices will be less than those implied by the cost‐of‐carry model.

When there's a convenience yield $(y)$, forward prices tend to be less than those implied by the cost‐of‐carry model. 

#### Example 2

The spot price of a commodity is R10 while its 6‐month futures price is R10.12.
Given that annual financing rate is 3%, annual spoilage rate is 2%, and storage cost per month is R0.02, what is implied annual convenience yield?

=>

The 6-month financing cost is $R10 \times 0.03 \times \frac{6}{12} = R0.15$

The 6-month spoilage cost is $R10 \times 0.02 \times \frac{6}{12} = R0.10$

The storage cost is $R0.02 \times 6 = R0.12$

Thus, convenience yield (CY) is found from
$$\text{Futures Price} = R10.12 = R10 + R0.15 +R0.10 + R0.12 - (CY \times R10 \times \frac{6}{12})$$
$$\rightarrow CY = 5\% \text{ per year}$$

- Harvests, Supply Elasticity, and Shifts in Demand

A key issue in understanding term structure of forward prices is rate at which and extent to which changes in supply and demand of commodity can be predicted. 

With regard to supply, on one end of the spectrum is a perfectly elastic supply.

Perfectly elastic supply is market in which any quantity demanded can be instantaneously and limitlessly supplied without changes in market price, and associated with little or no convenience yield. 

On the other end of the spectrum are commodities with inelastic supply. 

Inelastic supply is when supplies of item change slowly in response to market prices or when large changes in market prices are necessary to effect supply changes, and associated with high convenience yield. 

When supply of commodity cannot respond quickly to meet changing demand, it's likely that its convenience yield will be higher, since users of the commodity have greater fear of shortages.

Inelastic demand is market condition in which demand for a good does not increase/decrease substantially due to changes in price and is a potential cause of higher price volatility and higher convenience yield.

Forecasts of supply and demand shifts can affect not only the current price level of a commodity but also the slope and shape of the term structure of forward prices. 

These potential complexities add to both threats and opportunities for commodities traders and managers of managed futures programs. 

- Backwardation and Contango

The term structure (i.e. futures or forward curve) is formed as the relation between delivery dates and price (or rates). 

In the case of futures contracts, the possible delivery (settlement) dates are determined by the exchange on which the futures are traded and are spaced in weeks, months, or quarters. 

Forward contract settlement dates are negotiated between parties and can occur on virtually any trading day.

When term structure of forward prices is upward sloping (i.e. more distant forward contracts have higher prices than nearby contracts), the market is in contango. 

Contango also refers to forward price exceeding current spot price (viewing spot price as forward price with zero time to delivery). 

When slope of term structure of forward prices is negative, the market is in backwardation, or is backwardated. 

The concept of backwardation is complement to contango.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=5cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/3.2.2 Im50.png"}
\end{center}

The term structure of forward prices on financial securities is upward sloping (i.e. in contango) when the riskless rate exceeds the underlying asset's dividend yield. 

The slope is downward (i.e. in backwardation) if dividend yield on deliverable (underlier) exceeds risk‐free rate.

- How Backwardation and Contango Reflect Cost of Carry in a Perfect Market

The slope of term structure of forward prices is driven entirely by two costs of carry: interest rates and dividends (the benefits of dividends are included as a negative cost). 

A critical assumption is perfect financial markets in which there are no transactions costs, or restrictions on transactions, especially short‐selling.

In a perfect and informationally efficient market for financial assets, contango and backwardation occur to prevent arbitrage opportunities that'd otherwise exist if term structure of forward contracts on financial assets were flat when riskless rate differed from dividend yield.

The determination of financial forward prices illustrates two important points: 

  1) backwardation, contango, and the entire slope and shape of term structure are determined by differences in cost of carry, and 
  
  2) in efficient market, all forward contracts offer equal risk‐adjusted expected returns, regardless of slope and shape of term structure of forward prices.

- Backwardation and Contango in an Imperfect Market

Three major issues inhibit arbitrage activity that ensures relation between carrying costs and shape of forward curves:

  i) unlike cost of carry to a financial security (cost of financing), the storage costs of commodities vary substantially through time and among market participants. 
  Supply of physical storage facilities is inelastic, thus changes in demand for storage can dramatically affect marginal storage costs.
  
  ii) unlike benefit of carry to a financial security (dividends and other distributions), the convenience yield to commodities vary substantially through time and among market participants.
  Marginal benefits of holding inventories can change dramatically based on current and anticipated inventory levels. 

  iii) difficulties in borrowing commodities, especially those in short supply, inhibit the ability of arbitrageurs to short‐sell such that forward prices are driven to levels based on cost‐of‐carry model, including convenience yield.

- The Basis of Forward and Futures Contracts

The basis of futures or forward contracts is defined as spot price minus futures or forward price, or the basis is defined as forward price minus spot price. 

Basis risk describes the risk associated with potential mismatches between two (hedged) positions.

Within the context of forward and futures contracts, basis risk is dispersion in economic returns associated with changes in relation between spot prices and futures prices. 

The basis of a forward contract with delivery in $T$ years $(F_T)$ on a referenced asset with price, S, is:
$$\text{Basis} = S - F_T$$

Basis is equal to present value of carrying costs (multiplied by −1, depending on definition used).

Note at delivery (i.e. time T) S = $F_T$ (i.e. prices converge at delivery, since forward contract with zero time to delivery is a spot transaction).

Convergence is defined as spot price approaching forward price as delivery approaches, also viewed as the basis approaching zero as the time of delivery approaches.

An arbitrageur/trader hedging spot positions against forward positions analyzes the basis, compares it to carrying costs, and attempts to identify mispricing. 

To the extent that markets are informationally efficient, a position that is short the forward contract and long the spot price is hedged and should offer an expected return equal to the cost of carry (before transaction costs). 

The opposite position (long futures and short spot) is borrowing money by selling or short selling an asset. 

The trade is also riskless and generates a borrowing cost equal to carrying costs.

- Calendar Spreads on Forward Contracts

Traders hedging forward contracts against each other focus on calendar spread between prices of contracts
$$\text{Calendar Spread} = F_{T+t} - F_T$$
where $t$ - length of time separating settlement dates of contracts.

A calendar spread is viewed as difference between futures prices (or forward prices) on the same underlying asset but with different settlement dates. 

A calendar spread is also viewed as a position: simultaneous long and short positions in forward contracts with same underlying commodity but with different times to delivery. 

The trader calculate calendar spread as a numerical concept, and put on a calendar spread by taking hedged positions in the contracts.

Other types of spreads are formed based on distinctions between contracts other than settlement dates.

Calendar spread trading focuses on search for relatively mispriced futures or forward contracts on same commodity but with different settlement dates. 

Calendar spread trading is a speculation on changes in shape and slope of term structure of forward prices.

- The Return on a Calendar Spread

If term structure of forward prices has a slope, then notional value of each contract differs, and a trader with offsetting positions with equal numbers of contracts will not be hedged in terms of notional values.

Calendar spreads that contain long and short positions of equal notional value are hedged against changes in the spot price.

Changes in spot price (everything else being equal) may be viewed as causing a parallel or additive shift in entire term structure of forward prices.

Changes in costs of carry cause a slope change in term structure of forward prices.

Returns on calendar spreads are driven by two equivalent concepts: changes in slope of term structure of forward prices, and changes in carrying costs.

- The Risks of a Calendar Spread

Individual positions in forward contracts are quite sensitive to price of underlying asset. 

But a calendar spread based on notional values have little or no sensitivity to price of underlying asset.

The sensitivity of the price of a forward contract with respect to the carrying costs is proportional to the time to settlement of the contract (t). 

This leads to 2 properties regarding risks of calendar spreads:

  i) The value of calendar spread is sensitive to carrying costs. 
  The degree of sensitivity that calendar spread has to carry costs is driven by amount of time that separates the times to settlement of the contracts that form the spread. 
  Thus, spreads with underlying contracts that differ more in longevity are riskier.
  
  ii) Spreads that long the longer‐term contract benefit when costs of carry rise, and suffer when costs of carry decline. 
  The intuition is the benefit of forward contract is avoiding costs of carrying a cash position in an asset. 
  When carrying costs rise, longer‐term forward contracts enjoy a larger increase in total benefits than enjoyed by shorter‐term contracts.

\newpage

### Rolling of Forward and Futures Contracts

The excess return of futures contract is return generated exclusively from changes in futures prices.

- Why Returns on a Futures Contract Can Differ from the Spot Return

A fully collateralized position is a position in which the cash necessary to settle the contract has been posted in the form of short‐term, riskless bonds. 

Total returns from fully collateralized futures or forward returns differ from returns on spot positions on the same asset primarily due to basis risk. 

The basis risk that causes realized returns on fully collateralized commodity futures contract or forward contract to differ from the total return on the underlying spot position may be divided into three primary sources: 

  1) when costs of carry to marginal investor for spot position are not the same as costs implied by the basis, 
  
  2) when convenience yield from spot position differs from its storage costs, and 
  
  3) when basis changes. 
  
The first issue would indicate informational market inefficiency in pricing futures contract.

The second issue is, in equilibrium, if spot position offers a convenience yield that does not exactly offset its storage costs, $c − y$ is positive and spot price must be lower than when convenience yield is high.

While inventory holder may not earn convenience yield, there is an indirect benefit of having sufficient inventories preventing a stock‐out that slows their business operations. 

The third issue is a consequence of uncertainty.

- Components of Futures Returns

Useful formulas depict components of total return of collateralized futures position: a two‐component formula and a three‐component formula.

The return on a fully collateralized position,
$$R_{fcoll} = \text{Collateral Yield } + \text{ Excess Return}$$
expresses total return from an unleveraged, fully collateralized commodity futures position as sum of interest earned from riskless bonds used to collateralize the futures contract (collateral yield) and percentage price change in futures contract (excess return).

The price of futures/forward contract is viewed as equaling spot price minus basis. 

The excess return (change in futures price) is broken into the change in spot price and the change in the basis. 

By substituting the change in spot price and the change in  basis into above equation, in place of excess return, the total return from this unleveraged, fully collateralized commodity futures position can be expressed as coming from three primary sources.

  i) changes in spot price of underlying commodity, 
  
  ii) interest earned from riskless bonds used to collateralize futures contract, and 
  
  iii) changes in contract's basis (i.e. roll yield)

$$R_{fcoll} = \text{Spot Return} + \text{Collateral Yield} + \text{Roll Yield}$$

Spot return is return on price of underlying asset in spot market.

The returns of unhedged futures positions are driven by spot return.

Exposure to spot price changes is why most market participants enter futures contracts, and why market participants wishing to gain exposure to commodity prices establish positions in futures contracts on commodities. 

There is not a single centralized spot market or a single network of spot markets that provides a single universally recognized spot price for most physical assets.

Collateral yield is the interest earned from riskless bonds or other money market assets used to collateralize futures contract.

Positions in futures contracts are partially collateralized in that they only post collateral that's equal to margin required by futures exchanges. 

Partial collateralization generates leveraged returns, since the value changes of entire futures position is borne by a smaller collateral amount. 

Fully collateralized positions are unleveraged, since the cash invested equals the economic exposure of futures contract.

Depending on interest rate levels, the collateral yield can be substantial part of total return to a fully collateralized commodity futures position.

Changes in futures position basis, known as roll yield or roll return.

Roll yield/return is defined as portion of return of futures position from change in contract's basis through time.

The basis of a futures contract changes for two reasons:

  i) As time passes, the time to settlement of futures contract shortens, and contract's price (and basis) rolls up or down the term structure of forward prices toward spot price. 
  
  ii) As components of cost of carry vary (interest rates, dividend yields for financial futures contracts, storage costs, or convenience yields), the basis also vary, since basis depends directly on the four components of cost of carry. 

- Two Interpretations of Rolling Contracts

It describes transactions involved in switching, or rolling from, a short‐term futures contract to a futures contract with a longer term to settlement in the process of maintaining a continuous exposure to the underlying asset

Other times the rolling of a contract describes how its price "rolls up" (or down) the term structure of forward prices as its time to settlement nears.

The two interpretations of rolling a contract lead to two interpretations of roll return or roll yield.

When rolling a contract is viewed as holding a futures position while its time to settlement nears and its price rolls up or down the forward curve, then roll return is viewed as change in contract's basis through time. 

This view of roll return tends to be associated with financial economics view of risk and return.

When rolling a contract is viewed as a transaction, roll return is viewed as profit or loss recognized at time that position in a futures contract is rolled from one contract to another. 

This view of roll return is used to adjust excess futures returns in the process of reporting returns of continuous commodity exposures. 

This view of roll return tends to be associated with an accounting view of returns.

Rolling between contracts is viewed as recognizing a gain or loss that was previously accrued. 

But recognition of accrued gains (and rolling of contracts) does not create wealth or return.

- Roll Yield and the Slope of the Forward Curve

An important topic in commodity futures is relation between slope of term structure of forward prices (i.e. forward curve) and the sources of return from holding a futures contract.

Holding a long position in a futures contract when a market is in backwardation tends to be a successful strategy because it earns roll return (or roll yield).

The idea is that as time passes and the time to settlement of a futures contract diminishes, the future's price rises as the futures contract "rolls up" the downward‐sloping curve of a backwardated market. 

That is, market participants can earn consistently superior risk‐adjusted returns from positive roll yield generated from long positions in futures contracts when markets are backwardated.

The argument that roll return generates superior returns in backwardated markets for long futures positions implies that roll return generates superior returns in contango markets for short futures positions.

Roll return is argued to lead to inferior returns for long positions in markets that are in contango and inferior returns for short positions in markets that are backwardated.

The slope of term structure of forward prices depends on the costs of carry.

In informationally efficient market, a non-zero slope of the term structure of forward prices exists to prevent superior risk‐adjusted returns.

That is, the term structure takes on a positive or negative slope (contango or backwardated) based on carrying costs, so risk‐adjusted returns of spot positions and fully collateralized futures positions will be equal.

Commercial holders of inventories benefit from convenience yield, which drive futures price to be less than or equal to spot price adjusted for interest rates and storage costs.

In informationally efficient market, roll return is the change in basis that allows identical exposures in cash and futures markets to offer identical total returns. 

- Roll Yield, Carrying Costs, the Basis, and Alpha

There are 3 ways of expressing the relation between spot and forward prices through time: 

  1) the basis, 
  
  2) carrying costs, including convenience yield, and 
  
  3) roll yield. 
  
NB: All three of these terms express the same concept.

In informationally efficient market (and when carrying costs are expressed as present values rather than as rates or percentages), the absolute value of carrying costs will equal the absolute value of the basis. 

The roll yield is the same as the basis (and carrying costs) when viewing return on a futures contract through its settlement. 

NB: roll yield is defined as change in the basis. 

Since the basis of a futures contract or forward contract is zero at settlement, the roll yield of a futures contract to settlement must equal the contract's starting basis.

In the case of futures contracts on financial assets, the costs of carry for underlying financial asset are financing costs expressed as interest rate (r) and rate of dividends, coupons, or other distributions (d) that are received and are entered as a negative cost (−d).

While r is observable, d is assumed to be predictable. 

Assume all market participants are unanimous with regard to these values and can engage in transactions to receive or pay the same values of r and d. 

The actions of arbitrageurs in these markets should force financial futures toward a high degree of informational efficiency in which roll yield equals the cost of carry, which determines (and equals) the basis.

In the case of real assets, the carrying costs of holding real asset include storage cost, c, and convenience yield, y.

Storage costs and convenience yields on real assets are heterogeneous between market participants. 

A heterogeneous value differs across one or more dimensions. 

In this case, individual market participants may have different costs and benefits (c and y) from holding a real asset. 

These costs and benefits is unobservable to others.

A clear benefit of futures markets on real assets is the market's ability to facilitate the efficient bearing of storage costs and reaping of convenience yields. 

A major source of superior risk‐adjusted returns using futures contracts on real assets emanates from the heterogeneous costs of carry across market participants.

The key for a market participant to generate alpha through analysis of carrying costs and the basis is to execute trades when the prices of futures contracts imply costs of carry that deviate from the participant's costs of carry. 

- The Strategy of Rolling Contracts Affects Return Expectations

There are two issues: rollover decisions and collateral investment decisions.

Within futures markets, individual investors roll their futures positions over at different times relative to settlement and may differ in the selection of which settlement date to use for the new positions. 

The rollover decision has two components: when to exit a position and which longevity to select for the new futures or forward position.

Accordingly, it's not possible to identify a pattern of rollovers that is common to all investors and to identify the return of a particular pattern of rollovers as being representative of the returns achieved by all investors. 

The return of a fully collateralized strategy depends on the interest rate that is earned on the collateral. 

- The Impact of Rolling Contracts on Alpha

The difference between two rollover strategies are equal to a simple calendar spread strategy.

All other rollover strategies generate a return that's equal to return of that classic rollover strategy plus return of a short calendar spread. 

If markets are inefficient, its possible to earn a consistently superior or inferior risk‐adjusted return through adoption of a particular rollover strategy.

Any advantage between two rollover strategies is identical to the advantage of an equivalent strategy using calendar spreads (in a perfect market). 

Speculating on rollover strategies is tantamount to speculating on calendar spreads.

When transaction costs are included, some rollover strategies may be more cost‐effective than others.

- Three Propositions Regarding Roll Return

The common definition of roll return (or roll yield) is the return accrued in a futures position through time, attributable to changes in the basis of the futures contract.

The following three propositions highlight key issues.

Proposition 1: Roll return is not generated when one position is closed and a new position is opened.

Roll return occurs throughout the time that a particular futures or forward contract is held. 

Roll return is the difference between price at which a particular contract is opened and the price at which that same contract is closed in excess of the return on a spot position in the contract's underlying commodity.

Proposition 2: Roll return is not positive when markets are backwardated for holding periods shorter than being held to settlement. 

It's true that roll return is positive in backwardated markets if none of the components of costs of carry change. 

If costs of carry change, then even in backwardated markets there is no guarantee that roll return will be positive prior to settlement.

It's likely for term structure of forward rates to shift such that roll return will be negative in a backwardated market.

Proposition 3: A position that generated a positive roll return does not indicate the position's total returns were superior (i.e. that there was alpha). 

Roll return is part of total returns that make futures contracts and cash positions equally attractive.

Roll return is usually negative, to punish the forward position (relative to cash position) for not requiring a cash investment relative to a spot position.

In the case of a forward contract or futures contract on a financial asset held to settlement, roll return equals carrying costs times −1: (d − r). 

If dividend yield of a financial asset exceeds riskless rate, then roll return is positive if position is held to settlement.

### Normal Backwardation and Normal Contango

Backwardation and contango are the relationship between current spot prices and the prices of futures contracts of various settlement dates.

- Normal Backwardation

A subtle distinction exists between backwardation and normal backwardation. 

In normal backwardation, the forward price is believed to be below the expected spot price. 

We say "believed to be" because we cannot observe the expected spot price; we can only estimate it, and those estimations may differ between market participants.

Since in normal backwardation the expected spot price exceeds the forward price, there is a positive expected return from holding the futures contract. 

A long position in a forward contract involves an expected profit in the case of normal backwardation (with no investment other than the posting of collateral that can earn interest).

Normal backwardation does not mean that markets are informationally inefficient, even though a forward contract in a market with normal backwardation would offer an expected profit with no investment; this is because any expected profit could be due to compensation for bearing risk.

The concept of normal backwardation is silent on whether the expected profit of a long position is alpha or is a risk premium for bearing systematic risk. 

The entity on the long side of the forward contract should expect to earn a profit (risk premium) for bearing the risk of being long the commodity whenever the underlying systematic risk (i.e. beta) is positive.

- Normal Contango

Normal contango is an infrequently used term that refers to relationship between forward prices and expected spot prices in which the forward price is believed to be above the expected spot price. 

The entity on the short side of the forward contract should expect to earn a profit from bearing the risk of being short the commodity.

Conversely, the entity on long side of the forward contract should expect to bear a loss.

In informationally efficient market, normal contango would only exist for commodity forwards with negative betas.

Normal contango is a rare occurrence.

In an informationally inefficient market, normal contango would exist because a particular forward contract is overpriced and offers negative ex ante alpha to the long side and positive ex ante alpha to the short side.

- Interpreting Normal Backwardation and Normal Contango

Unlike backwardation and contango, normal backwardation and normal contango cannot be directly observed, because expected spot prices cannot be observed.

Forward markets sometimes assume forward or futures prices are equal to expected spot prices.

But in efficient market, forward and futures prices must differ from expected spot prices whenever the position involves systematic risk. 

The excess of expected spot price over forward price is expected reward for bearing the risk of being long the forward contract when underlying asset has positive systematic risk.

The expected loss to short side of the contract is the cost of using the forward contract to hedge systematic risk. 

The only time that forward or futures prices should equal expected spot prices in an informationally efficient market is when underlying asset contains no systematic risk.

In perfect capital markets, the price (or rates) of forward contracts on financial assets have term structures with slopes and curves that are driven entirely by observable costs of carry (interest rates and distributions). 

The relation between forward prices and expected spot prices is driven by risk premiums based on systematic risks of assets underlying the forwards.

The relationship between expected spot prices and futures prices is not directly observable, it's determined by risk premiums, and it's distinct from relation between current spot prices and current futures prices (determined by costs of carry).

- Keynes and Normal Backwardation

Keynes argued commodity futures prices should be lower than expected future spot prices (i.e. futures and forward markets are in normal backwardation). 

Keynes's reasoning was based on assumption that producers of commodity have strong incentive to lock in sales price today for future production by selling futures contracts (pushing down futures prices), but users of commodity have a strong incentive to purchase at spot prices (raising spot pricing). 

If there's natural oversupply of futures contracts, then speculators will enter the market to purchase the excess supply, but only at a discount to expected future spot price.

This exerts downward pressure on long‐term futures prices relative to expected spot prices, leading to markets with normal backwardation.

In fixed‐income world, this argument is similar to liquidity preference hypothesis.

The liquidity preference hypothesis holds that producers of bonds (borrowers) prefer issuing long maturities, whereas consumers of bonds (lenders) prefer purchasing short maturities, distorting relative prices or rates from reflecting unbiased expectations. 

Producers offer attractive longer‐term yields, which mean relatively low long‐term bond prices, to entice borrowers to extend their maturity or to induce speculators to borrow at short maturities and lend at long maturities. 

Speculators are compensated for providing a service (time intermediation) to the market. 

They provide demand by establishing long positions in long‐term futures contracts to counter excess supply generated by net short producers.

This supports futures prices at level above where they might lie in absence of speculators. 

The positive risk premium entices speculators to enter the market despite the risk.

- Commodity Forward Curves, Storage Costs, and Inventory Variation

Models of commodity forward curve predict the curve will be upward sloping when the current inventory levels are much greater than threshold levels of demand (low convenience yield), and it'll be downward sloping when inventories are exceptionally tight (high convenience yield). 

Storage models are unique to real assets. 

They do not have a corresponding model in fixed income because, except for financing, there is no cost of carry for bonds.

Another factor incorporated into storage models is risk of stock‐out, which occurs when storage effectively drops to zero, resulting in consumption being entirely dependent on production and transportation networks, and occurs in markets with peak seasonal demand or with annual crop cycles.

To avoid stock‐out, users of a commodity have an incentive to hedge more actively at points on the forward calendar that are most susceptible to stock‐out.

The theory of storage is illustrated in the working curve, which positively relates the slope of the forward curve to current levels of inventory such that low inventory levels are associated with negative and nonlinear forward curve slope. 

The nonlinearity is due to embedded real options related to inventory levels.

When inventory is low, users of commodity face costs related to searching, delays, rush charges, and transportation. 

In the extreme, they face significant costs from stock‐outs as inventory is depleted.

- Commodity Forward Prices and the Market Segmentation Hypothesis

Commodity forward curves are determined by liquidity preference or liquidity premium and the desire of producers to hedge their anticipated commodity sales with short positions in long‐term forwards or futures.

In some markets, the users of commodity rarely use forward market to hedge future commodity needs.

These particular markets exist for products that are directly consumed by the public.

In some cases, the forward curve is better explained by reasoning used in fixed‐income markets in discussions of the market segmentation (i.e. preferred habitat) hypothesis, in which the relation between expected spot rates and forward rates varies non-monotonically throughout the range of delivery dates due to supply and demand pressures in localized regions of the curve.

Under market segmentation hypothesis, the net supply or demand for specific futures contracts by natural hedgers is positive or negative depending on market conditions and preferences of producers and users to hedge their risks.

As a result, speculators need to take short or long positions to absorb the excess demand or excess supply of futures contracts created by hedgers.

To the extent that market participants demand substantial risk premiums to stray from using their preferred time to settlement to another longevity, the risk premium in the futures markets vary across times to settlement.

If participants have a preferred habitat (i.e. time to settlement) and the market is segmented (participants are reluctant to hedge contracts of varying times to settlement), there could be non-monotonic slopes to forward curves, such as a humped curve.

A humped curve means that the market is in contango in the short term, but gives way to backwardation for longer‐maturity contracts. 

- Option‐Based Models of the Forward Curve for Commodities

Option‐based models of term structure focus on two types of real options embedded in commodity markets. 

Real options embedded in commodity markets are implied options involving real assets.

i) The first type of real option is the option to extract a natural resource.
The option to extract (or defer extraction of) the resource dampens the volatility of commodity prices for future delivery.

ii) The second real option embedded in the commodity forward curve is related to inventories.
A volatility asymmetry is a difference in values between two analogous volatilities, such as the case with commodities, in which volatility is higher when prices are rising than when they are falling.
This is because shortages tend to cause more serious problems than surpluses. 
The volatility asymmetry favors owning physical inventory (or short‐dated futures contracts) over longer‐dated futures contracts. 
All other things being equal, this factor will tend to flatten commodity futures curves or lead to backwardation.

### Commodity Exposure and Diversification

- Commodities as Diversifiers

Commodities are viewed as an asset class that helps diversify a portfolio of traditional assets (stocks and bonds) through a lack of return correlation between commodities and traditional assets.

Four reasons why commodity returns have low correlation with stock prices and bond prices:

  i) Commodities have prices not directly determined by discounted value of future cash flows.
  Commodity prices are not as directly related to changes in forecasted cash flows and changes in market discount rates. 
  Commodity prices are evaluated primarily on forecasts of commodity's supply and demand. 
  
  ii) Nominal commodity prices are positively correlated with inflation largely because commodity prices form part of inflation.  
  Real commodity prices are unaffected by inflation. 
  Both the real and nominal prices of stocks and bonds are negatively correlated with inflation because inflation raises the discount rates applied to their valuations.
  
  iii) Commodity prices react very differently at different parts of the business cycle. 
  The value of stocks and bonds is derived from expectations regarding long‐term earnings or coupon payments.
  Commodities are priced more on the state of current economic conditions and factors regarding short‐term supply and demand.
  
  iv) Commodities are major cost of corporate producers.
  In the short run, a major increase in commodity prices may cause a substantial decline in corporate profits, and a decline in commodity prices may result in an increase in profits. 

- Commodities as Diversifiers in a Perfect Market Equilibrium

In CAPM (capital asset pricing model), the perfectly diversified portfolio is market portfolio that contains exposure to all assets and contains exposure to each of those assets in proportion to their total market value (i.e. size).

The percentage of total market portfolio attributable to each asset in that portfolio is the market weight.

The market weight of an asset is equal to the percentage of the total global value of that asset relative to the total global value of all assets. 

In a perfect market in equilibrium, any investor with a portfolio of risky assets that has an asset exposure greater than or less than its market weight is speculating on idiosyncratic risk.

In a perfect market equilibrium, bearing idiosyncratic risk does not offer higher expected returns.

Based on CAPM, the only issue in determining appropriate exposure to each commodity is determining the market weight of that commodity. 

However, ascertaining the total global market value of a commodity is difficult in practice. 

- Commodities as Diversifiers in the Presence of Market Imperfections

In practice, markets are in a continuous state of disequilibrium and remain substantially out of equilibrium for extended periods of time, which offer the opportunity for an asset class to offer benefits as a diversifier without also offering commensurately lower returns. 

Often commodity shortages and oversupplies cannot be quickly corrected by price mechanisms. 

In disequilibrium, participants hold substantially different exposures to various asset classes, especially commodities, than exposures based on market weights.

If one market participant holds an asset in a higher proportion than its market weight, then some other market participants must hold that asset in a lower proportion than its market weight.

In imperfect markets and in disequilibrium, it's no longer clear that all market participants can or should hold oil or any other commodity in their portfolios with a weight equal to the market weight of that commodity.

In that case, investors seek to hold commodities in the proportion that provides the highest return‐to‐risk ratio based on their existing portfolios and such circumstances as the structure of their liabilities.

- Commodities as Diversifiers against Unexpected Inflation

When rates of inflation are steady, asset prices adjust such that expected nominal returns of each asset reflect anticipated inflation.

Steady and anticipated inflation is not generally a serious investment risk or a determinant of real returns. 

Unexpected inflation can be a serious risk to investors.

Real assets and commodities in particular offer protection against inflation risk. 

Inflation risk is the dispersion in economic outcomes caused by uncertainty regarding the value of a currency and it emanates from the divergence between realized and anticipated rates of inflation (i.e. unanticipated inflation).

There are two intuitive explanations for protection from inflation risk provided by commodities:

  i) Commodity prices are an important component (i.e. determinant) of the price indices that measure inflation. 
  Thus, general price indices (and realized inflation rates) tend to be positively correlated with commodities. 
  
  ii) The value of a commodity is its perceived ability to provide consumption. 
  Because of their homogeneity and ability to be transported, commodity prices tend to be determined by global factors rather than local factors. 
  Therefore, in each country local commodity prices should adjust quickly to changes in the value of the local currency.
