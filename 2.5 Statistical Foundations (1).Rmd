# Topic 2: Introduction to Alternative Investments

## SubTopic 2.5: Statistical Foundations

### Return Distributions

Risky assets experience unexpected value changes and therefore unexpected returns. 

If we assume investors are rational, the more competitively traded an asset, the more these unexpected price changes may be random and unpredictable. 

Thus asset prices and asset returns in competitively traded markets are modeled as random variables. 

Frequency and probability distributions provide starting points for describing asset returns.

- Ex Ante and Ex Post Return Distributions

Ex post returns are realized outcomes rather than anticipated outcomes. 

Future possible returns and their probabilities are expectational or ex ante returns.

Predictions are formed partially/fully through analysis of ex post (i.e. historical) data. 

The direct use of past return behavior as a predictor of future potential return behavior requires two properties to be accurate:

  i) Return distribution must be stationary through time, i.e. expected return and dispersion of the underlying asset do not change
  
  ii) The sample of past observations must be sufficiently large to be likely to form a reasonably accurate representation of the process

The requirements for past returns to be representative of the future returns raise a serious challenge:

  i) If past observation period is long, the sample of historical returns will be large; however, it's likely that the oldest observations reflect different risks or other economic conditions than can be anticipated in the future. 
  
  ii) If the sample is limited to the most recent observations, the data may be more representative of future economic conditions, but the sample may be too small to draw accurate inferences from it.

For a traditional asset, its plausible that the asset's past behavior is a reasonable indication of its future behavior.

In alternative investments such as hedge funds, return distributions change as the fund's investment strategies and use of leverage change through time.

Thus, forecasted (ex ante) return distributions may need to be based on economic analysis and modeling rather than simply projected from historical (ex post) data.

Whether based on prior observations or on economic analysis, the return distribution is a central tool for understanding the characteristics of an investment.

- The Normal Distribution

is the bell‐shaped symmetric distribution, where the left and right sides are mirror images of each other. 

The normal distribution clusters or peaks near the center, with decreasing probabilities of extreme events.

It tends to approximate many distributions observed in nature or generated as the result of human actions and interactions, including financial return distributions. 

The more competitively traded an asset's price is, the more the price change over a small unit of time would be the result of hundreds or thousands of independent financial events and/or trading decisions. 

Therefore, the probability distribution of the resulting price change should resemble the normal distribution.

- Log Returns and the Lognormal Distribution

Returns are predominantly reported using discrete compounding.

Log returns may offer an advantage when modeling a return probability distribution. 

The use of log returns allows for the modeling of different time intervals in a manner that is simple and internally consistent.

The highest possible simple (non‐annualized) return is $+ \infty$, while the lowest possible simple return for a cash investment is a loss of −100%, which occurs if the investment becomes worthless.

The normal distribution spans from $- \infty$ to $+ \infty$, meaning that simple returns cannot truly be normally distributed.

The normal distribution may be a poor approximation of the actual probability distribution of simple returns.

However, log returns can span from $- \infty$ to $+ \infty$. 

There are two equivalent approaches to model returns that address these problems: 

  i) Use log returns and assume that they're normally distributed, or
  
  ii) Add 1 to the simple returns and assume it has a lognormal distribution

In summary, it's possible for returns to be normally distributed over a variety of time intervals if those returns are expressed as log returns (and are independent through time).

If log returns are normally distributed, then the simple returns (i.e. 1 + R) are lognormally distributed.

However, if discretely compounded returns (R) are assumed to be normally distributed, they can only be normally distributed over one time interval, since returns computed over other time intervals would not be normally distributed due to compounding.

Many investors assume normality when forecasting (ex ante) returns, but this assumption is problematic.

For a more robust modeling practice, investors may consider log returns in order to minimize these statistical issues. 

The tradeoff being that log returns (i.e. continuous compounding) may not be a realistic assumption for the given return series.

### Moments of the Distribution

The moments of a return distribution are measures that describe the shape of a distribution. 

The first four moments are referred to as mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis.

- First Moment: Mean

Using historical data, for a sample distribution of n observations, the mean is typically equally weighted.

$$\text{Mean} = \bar{R} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i R_i$$

is used as an estimate of the expected value when observations from the past are assumed to be representative of the future.

- Second Moment: Variance

is the probability weighted average of the deviations squared.

By squaring the deviations, any negative signs are removed, so the variance becomes a measure of dispersion.

Variance is often estimated with a sample of historical data. 
For a sample distribution, the variance with equally weighted observations is estimated:

$$\text{Variance} = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_i \left( R_i - \bar{R} \right)^2$$

The use of $n-1$, rather than $n$, enables a more accurate measure of the variance when the estimate of the expected value of the variable has been computed from the same sample. 

The square root of the variance is an extremely popular and useful measure of dispersion known as the standard deviation/volatility:

$$\text{Standard Deviation} = \sqrt{\sigma^2} = \sigma$$

- Third Moment

is the expected value of a variable's cubed deviations.

Skewness is equal to the third moment divided by the standard deviation of the variable cubed and serves as a measure of asymmetry:

$$\text{Skewness} = \frac{ \mathbb{E}[ (R - \mu)^3] }{\sigma^3}$$

Skewness is dimensionless, since changes in scale of the returns affect the numerator and denominator proportionately, leaving the fraction unchanged.

By cubing the deviations, the sign of each deviation is retained.

Cubing the deviations provides a measure of the direction in which the largest deviations occur, since cubing causes large deviations to be more influential than the smaller deviations.

The measure of skewness provides a numerical measure of the extent to which a distribution flares out in one direction or the other.

  i) A positive value indicates that the right tail is larger (the mass of the distribution is concentrated on the left side)
  
  ii) A negative value indicates that the left tail is larger (the mass of the distribution is concentrated on the right side)
  
  iii) A skewness of zero can result from a symmetrical distribution

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=7cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/2.5.2 Im21.png"}
\end{center}

- Fourth Moment: Kurtosis

Kurtosis is an indicator of the size of the extreme tails of a distribution.

$$\text{Kurtosis} = \frac{ \mathbb{E}[(R - \mu)^4]}{\sigma^4}$$

In the case of a normally distributed variable, the estimated kurtosis has a value that approaches 3.0 (as the sample size is increased).

Some investment analysis may subtract 3.0 from the result to derive a measure, known as excess kurtosis.

Excess kurtosis provides a more intuitive measure of kurtosis relative to the normal distribution because excess kurtosis has a value of zero in the case of the normal distribution:

$$\text{Excess Kurtosis} = \left( \frac{ \mathbb{E}[(R - \mu)^4] }{\sigma^4} \right) - 3$$

  i) A positive excess kurtosis signals a level of kurtosis that is higher than observed in a normally distributed variable, 
  
  ii) An excess kurtosis of 0.0 indicates a level of kurtosis similar to that of a normally distributed variable, and 
  
  iii) A negative excess kurtosis signals a level of kurtosis that is lower than that observed in a normally distributed variable

Kurtosis is viewed as capturing the fatness of the tails of a distribution, with high values of kurtosis (or positive values of excess kurtosis) indicating fatter tails (i.e. higher probabilities of extreme outcomes) than are found in the case of a normally distributed variable.

The mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of a return distribution indicate the location and shape of a distribution, and are a key part of measuring and communicating the risks and rewards of various investments.

All else equal, analysts would prefer to avoid investment exhibiting left skew and high kurtosis revealing a (historical) return series with higher probabilities of extreme outcomes and larger left tails (assuming they're not shorting).

- Platykurtosis, Mesokurtosis, and Leptokurtosis

If a return distribution has no excess kurtosis, it's said to be mesokurtic, mesokurtotic, or normal tailed, and to exhibit mesokurtosis.

If a return distribution has negative excess kurtosis, it's said to be platykurtic, platykurtotic, or thin tailed, and to exhibit platykurtosis. 

If a return distribution has positive excess kurtosis, it's said to be leptokurtic, leptokurtotic, or fat tailed, and to exhibit leptokurtosis.

The key to recognizing excess kurtosis visually is comparing the thickness of the tails of both sides of the distribution relative to the tails of a normal distribution.

\newpage

### Covariance and Correlation

Correlation affects diversification, which drives the risk of a portfolio of assets relative to the risks of the portfolio's constituent assets. 

Due to correlation, adding an asset on a stand-alone basis that exhibits a higher risk profile, can reduce the risk of an existing portfolio when added to that portfolio. 

- Covariance

The covariance of the return of two assets is a measure of the degree or tendency of two variables to move in relationship with each other.

  i) If two assets tend to move in same direction, they covary positively, and will have a positive covariance.
  
  ii) If two assets tend to move in opposite directions, they covary negatively, and will have a negative covariance.
  
  iii) If two assets move independently of each other, their covariance will be zero. 

Covariance is a statistical measure of the extent to which two variables move together, and not reported/interpreted on a stand-alone basis.

$$\text{Covariance} = \mathbb{E}[(R_i - \mu_i)(R_j - \mu_j)]$$

Can be estimated from a sample using:

$$\text{Cov}(R_i, R_j) = \sigma_{ij} = \frac{1}{(T-1)} \sum^T_{t=1} \left( [R_{it} - \bar{R}_i] [R_{jt} - \bar{R}_j] \right)$$
where $T$ is no. of time periods observed.

  i) When return deviations are in the same direction (i.e. same sign), the cross product is positive; 
  
  ii) When return deviations are in opposite directions (i.e. different signs), the cross product is negative 
  
When the cross products are summed, the resulting sum generates an indication of the overall tendency of the returns to move either in tandem or in opposition.

- Correlation Coefficient

measures the degree of association between two variables, but unlike the covariance, the correlation coefficient can be easily interpreted.

It takes the covariance and scales its value to be between +1 and −1 by dividing by the product of the standard deviations of the two variables.

  i) Correlation coefficient of −1 indicates the two assets move in the exact opposite direction and same proportion (i.e. perfect linear negative correlation). 
  
  ii) Correlation coefficient of +1 indicates the two assets move in the exact same direction and same proportion (i.e. perfect linear positive correlation). 
  
  iii) Correlation coefficient of zero indicates there is no linear association between the returns of the two assets.

Values between the two extremes of −1 and +1 indicate different degrees of association.

$$\rho_{ij} = \frac{\sigma_{ij}}{\sigma_i \sigma_j}$$

- The Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient

There are some useful measures of correlation in alternative investments that are based on the ranked size of the variables rather than the absolute size of the variables. 

The returns within a sample for each asset are ranked from highest to lowest.

The numerical ranks are then inserted into formulas that generate correlation coefficients that usually range between −1 and +1.

This is Spearman rank correlation coefficient.

The Spearman rank correlation is a correlation designed to adjust for outliers by measuring the relationship between variable ranks rather than variable values.

#### Example 1

Consider

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=2cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/2.5.3 Im22.png"}
\end{center}

=> Step 1: Replace actual returns with the rank of each asset's return. 
The ranks are computed by first ranking the returns of each asset separately, from highest (rank = 1) to lowest (rank = 3), while keeping the returns arrayed according to their time periods.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=2cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/2.5.3 Im23.png"}
\end{center}

=> Step 2: Compute $d_i$, the difference in the two ranks associated with time period i. 

The Spearman rank correlation ($\rho_s$), can be computed using those differences in ranks and the total number of time periods, n:

$$\rho_s = 1 - \frac{6 \times \sum_i d^2_i}{n(n^2 - 1)}$$

=> Step 3: Calculate $\rho_s$ (i.e. 0.5)

Rank correlation is preferred because of the way it handles the effects of outliers (extremely high or low data values).

Extremely high or very negative values of one or both of the variables in a particular sample can cause the computed Pearson correlation coefficient to be very near +1 or −1 based on the undue influence of the extreme observation on the computation, since deviations are squared as part of the computation.

By using ranks, the effects of outliers are lessened, and the resulting measure of the correlation using a sample is a better indicator of the true correlation that exists within the population. 

NB: Spearman rank correlation coefficient would be the same for any return that would generate the same rankings.

- The Correlation Coefficient and Diversification

The correlation coefficient is often used to demonstrate one of the most fundamental concepts of portfolio theory: the reduction in risk found by combining assets that are not perfectly positively correlated.

The below shows combining varying portions of assets A and B under three correlation conditions: perfect positive correlation, zero correlation, and perfect negative correlation.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=5cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/2.5.3 Im24.png"}
\end{center}

The highest possible correlation and least diversification potential is when the assets’ correlation coefficient is +1: perfect positive correlation.

The straight line to the lower right between points A and B plots the possible standard deviations and mean returns achievable by combining asset A and asset B under perfect positive correlation.

The line is straight, meaning that the portfolio risk is a weighted average of the individual risks.
That is, there are no benefits to diversification when perfectly correlated assets are combined. 

Diversification occurs when the risks of unusual returns of assets tend to cancel each other out. 

This does not happen in the case of perfect positive correlation, because the assets always move in the same direction and by the same proportion.

The greatest risk reduction occurs when the assets’ correlation coefficient is −1: perfect negative correlation. 

The two upper‐left line segments connecting points A and B plot the possible standard deviations and mean returns that would be achieved by combining asset A and B under perfect negative correlation. 

The line between A and B moves directly to the vertical axis (where standard deviation is zero). 

This illustrates ultimate diversification, therefore, combining the two assets into a portfolio results in rapid/total risk risk reduction. 

This zero‐risk portfolio illustrates the concept of a perfect two‐asset hedge and occurs when the weight of the investment in asset A is equal to the standard deviation of asset B divided by the sums of the standard deviations of A and B.

The risk that can be removed through diversification is called diversifiable, nonsystematic, unique, or idiosyncratic risk.

Assets that generate diversification benefits are shown to shift the attainable combinations of risk and return toward the benefit of the investor (i.e. less risk for same amount of return). 

Imperfect correlation leads to diversification that bends portfolio risk to the left, representing the improved investment opportunities afforded by diversification.

In the case of asset returns, true future correlations can only be estimated. 

Past estimated correlation coefficients not only are subject to estimation error but are also estimates of a moving target, since true correlations should be expected to change through time, as fundamental economic relationships change. 

Correlation coefficients tend to increase (i.e. offer less diversification across investments and asset classes) in times of market stress, just when an investor needs diversification the most.

\newpage

### Beta and Autocorrelation

- Beta

The beta of an asset is defined as:

  i) Covariance between the asset's returns and market index, divided by variance of index's return, or
  
  ii) Correlation coefficient multiplied by the ratio of the asset volatility to market volatility

$$\beta_i = \frac{\text{Cov}(R_m, R_i)}{\text{Var}(R_m)} = \frac{\sigma_{im}}{\sigma^2_m} = \rho_{im} \times \frac{\sigma_i}{\sigma_m}$$

The numerator measures the amount of risk that an individual stock brings into an already diversified portfolio. 

The denominator measures the total risk of the market portfolio. 

Beta thus measures added systematic risk as a proportion of the risk of the index.

In capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and other single‐factor market models, $R_m$ is return of the market portfolio, and beta is the responsiveness of asset i to fluctuations in the value of the market portfolio.

In single‐factor benchmark, $R_m$ is the return of the benchmark portfolio, and beta is the responsiveness of asset i to fluctuations in the benchmark.

In multifactor asset pricing model, beta is the responsiveness of asset i to fluctuations in the given risk factor.

Beta is similar to correlation coefficient, but not bounded by +1 on the upside and −1 on the downside.

There are several important features of beta:

  i) Can be easily interpreted, i.e. the beta of an asset is the percentage return response that an asset will have on average to a one‐percentage‐point movement in the related risk factor, such as the overall market.
  Actual returns deviate from expected returns due to any idiosyncratic risk. 
  Risk‐free asset has a beta of zero, and its return would not be expected to change with movements in the overall market. 
  The beta of the market portfolio is 1.0.
  
  ii) It's the slope coefficient in a linear regression of the returns of an asset (dependent variable) against the returns of the related index/market portfolio (independent variable).
  
  iii) Because beta is a linear measure, the beta of a portfolio is a weighted average of the betas of the constituent assets.
  Beta reflects correlation between an asset's return and return of the market (or specified risk factor) and because correlation to the market does not diversify away as assets are combined into a portfolio.

The beta between an asset and an index is estimated rather than observed. 

An estimate of beta formed with historical returns may differ substantially from an asset's true future beta:

  i) Historical measures such as beta are estimated with error
  
  ii) Beta of most assets change through time as market values change and as fundamental economic relationships change.

- Autocorrelation

The autocorrelation of a time series of returns from an investment refers to the possible correlation of the returns with one another through time.

First‐order autocorrelation refers to correlation between the return in time period t and the return in the previous time period (i.e. t − 1).

  i) Positive first‐order autocorrelation is when an above‐average (below‐average) return in time period t − 1 tends to be followed by an above‐average (below‐average) return in time period t. 

  ii) Negative first‐order autocorrelation is when an above‐average (below‐average) return in time period t − 1 tends to be followed by a below‐average (above‐average) return in time period t. 

  iii) Zero autocorrelation indicates that returns are linearly independent through time.

Positive autocorrelation is seen in trending markets; negative autocorrelation is seen in markets with price reversal (i.e. mean reversion) tendencies.

In alternative investments, arbitrage activity may not be sufficient to prevent non-trivial price patterns such as autocorrelation.

Autocorrelation in the context of a return series with constant mean:

$$\text{Autocorrelation} = \frac{ \mathbb{E}[(R_t - \mu) (R_{t-k} - \mu)] }{\sigma_t \sigma_{t-k}}$$

where $k$ is no. of time periods between the two returns.

Autocorrelations, like correlation coefficients, range between −1 and +1, with +1 representing perfect correlation.

There are unlimited combinations of autocorrelations that could be nonzero in a time series; thus, in practice, it's necessary to specify the time lags separating the correlations between variables.

The simplest and most popular specifications of the autocorrelation of a time series is first‐order autocorrelation (i.e. $k=1$).

The first‐order autocorrelation refers to the correlation between the return in time period t and the return in the immediately previous time period, t − 1.

Autocorrelation between returns diminishes as the time distance between them increases.

Autocorrelation in returns has implications for the relationship between the standard deviations of a return series computed over different time lengths. 

  i) If autocorrelation is positive (i.e. returns are trending), then standard deviation of returns over T periods will be larger than the single‐period standard deviation multiplied by the square root of T. 
  
  ii) If autocorrelation is zero, then standard deviation of returns over T periods will be equal to the single‐period standard deviation multiplied by the square root of T.
  
  iii) If autocorrelation is negative (i.e. returns are mean‐reverting), then the standard deviation of returns over T periods will be less than the single‐period standard deviation multiplied by the square root of T.

An informal approach to analysis of potential autocorrelation of a return series is through visual inspection of a scatter plot of $R_t$ against $R_{t-1}$.

  i) Positive autocorrelation causes more observations in the northeast and southwest quadrants of scatter plot, where $R_t$ and $R_{t-1}$ share same sign.
  
  ii) Negative autocorrelation causes the southeast and northwest quadrants to have more observations.
  
  iii) Zero autocorrelation causes balance among all four quadrants

- Higher‐Order Autocorrelation

Analysis of alternative investments involve consideration of whether a particular return series trend (positive autocorrelation of returns) or mean‐reverts (negative autocorrelation of returns).

Returns of some assets trend over some time intervals and mean‐revert over other time intervals.

The potential for returns to have positive and negative autocorrelation over different time horizons indicates that analysis of higher‐order autocorrelations is useful.
 
The second‐order autocorrelation between the returns in period $t$ and $t-2$ can be viewed as emanating from:

  i) Shared correlation of the two returns with the returns from period $t-1$ and
  
  ii) Potential correlation that is unique between periods $t$ and $t-2$ 

#### Example 2

Suppose a return series has a strong positive first‐order autocorrelation coefficient of 0.7.

=>

  i) If there's no further causality of returns beyond one period, the second‐order autocorrelation coefficient will be 0.49 (i.e. 0.7 × 0.7)
  
  ii) An observed second‐order autocorrelation coefficient significantly greater than 0.49 is an indication that there's additional positive relation between returns $t$ and $t-2$  beyond the correlation caused by the first‐order correlation.
  
  iii) An observed second‐order autocorrelation coefficient significantly less than 0.49 is an indication that there's a negative second‐order relation between returns $t$ and $t-2$ 

- The Durbin‐Watson Test for Autocorrelation

A formal approach in searching for presence of first‐order autocorrelation in a time series is through the Durbin‐Watson test. 

To test the hypothesis that there is no autocorrelation in a series involves calculating the Durbin‐Watson statistic:

$$\text{DW} = \frac{\sum^T_{t=2} (e_t - e_{t-1})^2}{\sum^T_{t-1} e^2_t}$$

In alternative investments, the series being analyzed ($e_t$) is returns or portion of returns, such as estimated active return.

  i) If DW = 2, then no significant autocorrelation (i.e. fails to reject hypothesis of zero autocorrelation)
  
  ii) If DW is statistically greater than 2, then the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of negative autocorrelation;
  
  iii) If DW is statistically less than 2, then the null hypothesis may be rejected in favor of positive autocorrelation. 

The magnitude of the difference from 2 required to reject zero autocorrelation is complex, but a rule of thumb is that zero autocorrelation is rejected when DW is greater than 3, which is negative autocorrelation, or less than 1, which is positive autocorrelation.

### Interpreting Standard Deviation and Variance

- Standard Deviation of Normally Distributed Returns

The standard deviation of investment's returns is roughly approximated as typical amount by which an investment's actual return deviates from its average.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=5cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/2.5.5 Im25.png"}
\end{center}

If returns were normally distributed, the standard deviation of the returns would help an investor know with precision what the probabilities of every outcome would be relative to its mean. 

Two‐thirds of the time, the returns should lie within 1 standard deviation of the mean.

For example, for one‐tail probabilities, the normal distribution is symmetric, so there would be a 0.13% probability that the return would be more than 11%.

For huge return aberrations, such as a move of 10 standard deviations, the normal distribution provides an underestimated indication of the actual probabilities of tail events. 

- Properties of Variance

The variance of an investment's return over a time interval of T periods can be expressed as T times the variance measured over a single period under particular assumptions.

The variance of the return of a portfolio (p) of n assets as a weighted average of the variances and covariances of the returns of the assets in the portfolio:

$$\sigma^2_p = \sum^n_{i=1} \sum^n_{j=1} w_i w_j \text{Cov}(R_i, R_j)$$

The above formula contains $n$ variances (one for each of the n assets) and $n^2 - n$ covariances (from the pairs of assets). The 

The additivity of the formula assists in financial modeling, such as Markowitz's pioneering work on risk and return, in which variance measured risk. 

In the case of uncorrelated returns between securities, the covariances between nonidentical assets are zero:

$$V(R_p) = \sum^n_{i=1} w^2_i \text{Var}[R_i]$$
where (correlation coefficient) $\rho = 0$ between all individual assets.

If returns are uncorrelated through time (i.e. no autocorrelation), all covariances vanish, and the variance of the weekly return is the sum of the variances of the daily returns:

$$V(R_w) = V(R_1) + V(R_2) + V(R_3) + V(R_4) + V(R_5) \hspace{12pt} \text{when } \rho_{t,t-k} = 0$$

Further if variances of the periodic returns of an asset are constant (i.e. homoskedastic), then the variance of the returns for a T‐period time interval is:
$$V(R_T) = T \times V(R_1) \hspace{12pt} \text{when } \rho_{t,t-k} = 0$$

  i) If returns are positively correlated in time (i.e. trending, or positively autocorrelated), then the variance will be larger than specified above
  
  ii) If returns are negatively correlated in time (i.e. mean‐reverting, or negatively autocorrelated), then variance will be smaller than specified above

- Properties of Standard Deviation

 1) The standard deviation of a portfolio of perfectly correlated assets is a weighted average of the standard deviations of the assets in the portfolio

$$\sigma_p = \sum^n_{i=1} w_i \times \sigma_i \hspace{12pt} \text{when } \rho_{ij}=1 \hspace{5pt} \forall i,j$$

  2) The standard deviation of Y is the product of standard deviation of X and the slope coefficient

$$\sigma_y = m \times \sigma_x$$

There are three useful applications of this property for investments:

  i) Returns of a levered position in an asset is approximated as a linear function of the returns of an unlevered position in the same asset.
  The standard deviation of the levered position ($\sigma_1$) is the product of the leverage (L) and standard deviation of the unlevered asset $\sigma_u$:
  
  $$\sigma_1 = L \times \sigma_u$$

  ii) The portfolio's return $R_p$ is a linear function of returns of the risky asset
  
  $$R_p = w \times R_m + (1-w) \times R_f$$
  Thus, noting the standard deviation of $R_f$ is zero and the correlation between risk‐free and risky assets is zero, the standard deviation of the portfolio:
  $$\sigma_p = w \times \sigma_m$$

  iii) The variance of a multi-period log return is the number of periods multiplied by the single‐period variance when the returns are homoskedastic and uncorrelated through time
  $$\sigma_T = \sigma_1 \times \sqrt{T} \hspace{12pt} \text{when } \rho_{t, t-k}=0$$

The equation above requires returns be independent through time and variances of single‐period returns be equal (i.e. homoskedastic). 

NB: A popular annualization factor in alternative investments is annual standard deviation by multiplying the standard deviation of monthly returns by the square root of 12​.

The standard deviation of multi-period return can be approximated as the sum of the standard deviations of the return of each sub‐period if returns are perfectly correlated. 

If standard deviation of each sub‐period is equal (i.e. standard deviation of asset is constant through time), then:

Perfect positive correlation of returns through time does not make economic sense, thus above equation is upper bound.

Comparing standard deviations of an asset using different time intervals for computing returns provides insight into statistical correlation of the returns through time (i.e. autocorrelation)

Whether a return series is trending, independent, or mean‐reverting drives the relationship between the asset's relative volatility over different time intervals.

### Testing for Normality

- Why Are Some Returns Markedly Non‐Normal?

The main reasons for non‐normality observed in alternative investment returns:

  i) Autocorrelation
  
Price changes through time for many alternative investments will not be statistically independent in terms of both their expected direction and their level of dispersion. 

Short‐term returns are positively autocorrelated if assets are not rapidly and competitively traded.

When reported returns can be influenced by an investment manager, it's possible the manager smooths the returns to enhance performance measures. 

Positive autocorrelation causes longer‐term returns to have disproportionately extreme values relative to short‐term returns.

That is, one extreme short‐term return tends to be more likely to be followed by another extreme return in the same direction, to the extent that the return series has positive autocorrelation.

The autocorrelated short‐term returns can generate highly dispersed longer‐term returns, such as returns that appear to be generated in speculative bubbles on the upside and panics on the downside.

  ii) Illiquidity

refers to the idea that alternative investments are thinly traded.

Observed market prices are heavily influenced by liquidity needs of market participants rather than driven toward an efficient price by the actions of numerous well‐informed buyers and sellers. 

With a small number of large factors affecting each trade, outcomes will not be normally distributed and extreme outcomes will be relatively common.

In illiquid markets, prices are estimated by models and professional judgments rather than by competitive market prices.

The prices generated by models or professional judgments tend to be autocorrelated. 

The resulting returns are smoothed and exhibit less volatility than would be indicated if true prices could be observed.

  iii) Nonlinearity
  
A short‐term call option is an asset with returns that are a nonlinear function of an underlying return factor.

As underlying asset's price changes, the call option experiences a change in its sensitivity to future price changes in the underlying asset. 

The dispersion in the call option's return distribution changes through time as the underlying asset's price changes, even if the volatility of the underlying asset remains constant.

The result is a highly non-symmetric return distribution over long time intervals. 

A similar phenomenon occurs for highly active trading strategies which cause returns to experience different risk exposures through time, such as when a strategy varies its use of leverage.

Many alternative investments tend to have markedly non‐normal log returns over medium‐ and long‐term time intervals. 

- The Jarque‐Bera Test for Normality

Skewness and kurtosis provide useful measures from which to test a sample for normality. 

The normal distribution has skewness equal to zero and excess kurtosis equal to zero.

Normality tests attempt to ascertain the probability that the observed skewness and kurtosis would occur if the sample had been drawn from an underlying distribution that was normal.

The Jarque‐Bera test involves a statistic that's a function of the skewness and excess kurtosis of the sample

$$JB = \frac{n}{6} \left( S^2 + \frac{K^2}{4} \right)$$
where 

  i) $JB$ - Jarque-Bera test statistic
  
  ii) $n$ - no. of observations
  
  iii) $S$ - skewness of the sample
  
  iv) $K$ - excess kurtosis of the sample

The null hypothesis is that the underlying distribution is normal and that JB is equal to zero (since skewness and excess kurtosis of normal distribution are both zero).

The Jarque‐Bera test will always be non-negativeas $S$ and $K$ are squared.

If the test did not square  $S$ and $K$, a negative skewness would offset a positive excess kurtosis, which would wrongly suggest normality.

As sample exhibits more tendencies of a normal distribution (less skewness and less excess kurtosis), the Jarque‐Bera test statistic will be closer to zero (holding n constant).

The Jarque‐Bera test for normality is whether the test statistic is large enough to reject the null hypothesis of normality.

If underlying distribution is normal, the value of JB generated from a sample will exceed zero with known magnitudes and probabilities given by chi‐squared distribution (with two degrees of freedom). 

If underlying distribution is normal, the size of Jarque‐Bera test statistic will be small, since a sample drawn from a normal distribution will have a low skewness and low excess kurtosis. 

The probability that the Jarque‐Bera test statistic will exceed particular values can be found from a chi‐squared distribution table

Steps to perform Jarque-Bera test:

  1) Select confidence interval (e.g., 90%, 95%, 97.5%, 99%, or 99.9%)
  
  2) Locate the corresponding critical value (e.g., 5.99 for 95% confidence)
  
  3) Compute the JB statistic
  
  4) Compare the JB statistic to the critical value

If the JB statistic > critical value, then the null hypothesis of normality is rejected using the stated level of confidence. 

If the JB statistic < critical value, then the null hypothesis is not rejected, and the underlying distribution is assumed to be normal.
