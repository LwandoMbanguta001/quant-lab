# Topic 5: Private Debt

## SubTopic 5.4: Introduction to Structuring

### Overview of Financial Structuring

Structuring is process of engineering unique financial opportunities from existing asset exposures. 

Financial structuring enables different investors to hold claims with different risk exposures (or other characteristics) from same underlying assets.

The most common major structuring of assets is capital structure of corporate form of business organization. 

This capital structure partitions risks of corporation’s underlying assets into claims of relatively low risk (debt) and relatively high risk (equity).

The capital structuring of business enterprise into debt and equity claims captures the most fundamental concepts and motivations to financial structuring: tailoring risks of securities to risk preferences of investors.

The capital structure of traditional operating firm is a very common application of concept of structuring for risk purposes. 

The risk purpose served by firm’s capital structure is the risk of firm’s assets partitioned among firm’s capital providers. 

Different security classes in firm are primarily differentiated by their levels of risk.

Structuring is used to differentiate ownership on attributes other than risk.

Taxation play important role in structuring. 
The idea is divvy up claims to asset, with cash flows being distributed based on aggregate tax minimization. 

In that scenario, highly taxed cash flows are distributed to tax‐exempt investors or investors in low tax brackets, while tax‐advantaged cash flows are distributed to investors in high tax brackets.

Structuring also accommodate other preferences, such as liquidity. 

Heterogeneous liquidity preferences are accommodated by structuring asset into short‐term claims for investors who place high value on liquidity and long‐term claims for investors less concerned about liquidity.

- Major Types of Structuring

Structured products are instruments created to exhibit particular return, risk, taxation, or other attributes. 

The key element of structured product is it offers investor altered exposure to one or more underlying assets.

A forward contract on equity index is not described as structured product because most forward contracts do not provide a substantially altered exposure to fundamental characteristics of underlying asset.

- Hedging with Credit Derivatives

Although credit derivatives, such as credit default swaps (CDS), are not referred to as structured products, they serve similar roles. 

Credit default swaps allow for cost‐effective transfer of default risk.

- Structuring with Tranches

CDOs are structures that partition risk of portfolio into ownership claims called tranches which differ in seniority.

More senior tranches are first to receive cash flows and last to bear losses.

The key point of CDO is to engineer the risk of portfolio into spectrum of risks tailored to meet needs, preferences, or market views of various investors. 

The tranching of CDOs performs a function similar to capital structure of operating corporation.

- Creating Structured Products

The term structured products is used as umbrella term to describe a spectrum of innovative financial instruments, or used to refer to specially tailored securities financially engineered to provide specific attributes, such as risk, that meet preferences of one or more investors. 

- The Primary Economic Role of Structuring

A structured product exists because both issuer of structured product and investor in structured product were driven by one or more economic motivations.

The primary direct motivation of issuer is to earn fees—either explicit fees or implicit fees. 

However, other motivations of issuer and investor exist.
The motivation to buyer is risk management, tax minimization, liquidity enhancement, or some other goal. 

From perspective of financial economist, the primary economic role of structured products is market completion.

- Completing Markets as an Economic Role

One of most central motivations to structured products is market completion.

A complete market is financial market in which enough different types of distinct securities exist to meet needs and preferences of all participants.

In idealized world of complete market, individual investors manage their wealth optimally because sufficient distinct securities exist to allow any desired investment exposure.

The financial market will never be fully completed. 

The term completing the market means the market is being brought one step closer to completion by offering investors unique opportunities with which to manage their finances.

- States of the World within Structured Products

In the real world of uncertainty and asymmetric information, markets are highly incomplete.

Incomplete markets are understood in the context of “states of the world.”

A state of the world, or state of nature (or state), is a precisely defined and comprehensive description of an outcome of economy that specifies the realized values of all economically important variables. 

The concept is theoretical since its impossible to fully describe the entire world or all states that could occur. 

The concept provides valuable insight into why many structured products exist.

- Structured Products as Market Completers

Although markets can never be complete, the primary role of structured products is to move them toward being more complete. 

People and organizations are viewed as analyzing future scenarios of the world (i.e. states of the world) and estimating their probabilities.

For risk management purposes, investors seek products that offer high payoffs in those states in which investor’s wealth would otherwise be low. 

For return enhancement purposes, investors seek products that offer high payouts in states that investor believes are unusually likely to occur. 

In both cases, the structuring of products serves economic role of meeting needs and preferences of these investors by completing the market. 

The structured products offer an otherwise unavailable combination of payoffs in various states that enables investor to better manage risk and return.

In context of alternative investments, financial institutions strive to meet preferences of various investors by creating securities or products that move market toward being more complete. 

Insurance companies are excellent example of type of financial institution that addresses deficiencies of incomplete markets. 

Major banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions offer structured products tailored to needs of individuals and institutions for risk management or risk enhancement purposes.

Its noted that many simple financial derivatives, such as call options and put options, trade in financial markets and used by market participants to manage basic risks of traditional assets, such as indices and individual securities. 

But when a market participant desires a product peculiar to individualized circumstances or preferences, structured products are the solution engineered to tailor a solution.

### Collateralized Mortgage Obligations

Collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) are example of highly effective and simple use of structuring. 

CMOs assemble mortgage assets and finance those assets by issuing securities. 

CMOs divide cash flows from assets such as mortgage pools or other mortgage‐related products and distribute them with varying characteristics to different classes of security holders.

- Prioritization of Claims within CMOs

The key distinguishing feature between CMOs and other investment pools, such as mutual funds or mortgage‐backed securities, is that CMOs use extensive structuring. 

CMOs are financed with security classes or tranches with substantially varied characteristics. 

A tranche is a distinct claim on assets that differs substantially from other claims in such aspects as seniority, risk, and maturity. 

Each tranche is tradable in units that differ in size.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=5cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/5.4.2 Im91.png"}
\end{center}

A CMO issuer structures these tranches to have different seniorities to cash flows from underlying mortgages. 

The above is a stylized CMO structure for insured mortgages with only three tranches. 
In practice, CMOs have numerous tranches.

The assets on left side are referred as collateral pool. 
The assets generate cash inflows structured and distributed to various tranches.

For insured residential mortgages, the structuring of cash flows focuses on maturity and cash flow timing, because lenders bear little or no risk of principal losses due to mortgage defaults. 

In the case of commercial mortgages and subprime residential mortgages, the focus of structuring of cash flows from mortgage pool is more on allocation of default losses, since these loans are not insured.

The issuer of CMO receives monthly mortgage payments (principal and interest payments) from collateral pool, and after collecting its fees, the issuer passes the payments on to various tranches, following procedures and priorities defined in CMO prospectus. 

Each tranche has a coupon its promised and prespecified priority in receiving distributions of principal payments.

- Structuring of Sequential‐Pay CMOs

The sequential‐pay collateralized mortgage obligation is simplest form of CMO. 

In sequential‐pay CMO, each tranche receives a pre-specified share of interest payments based on each tranche’s coupon and principal amount.

Each tranche also receives principal.
When there's no default risk, its the seniority to principal payments that's the focus of CMOs.

For sequential‐pay CMO, the first‐pay tranche (labeled as senior tranche) receives all principal repayments until tranche’s face value is fully repaid. 

As a tranche’s principal is paid down, its receipt of coupon payments is proportionately reduced.

A tranche matures once it received repayment of its entire principal value. 

The next senior tranche then receives entire principal payments until it, in turn, matures. 

There's a final tranche, called Z‐tranche, that receives any residual cash flows.

The purpose to the structuring offered by CMO is it provides investors with spectrum of risk‐and‐return opportunities.

The structuring of cash flows from underlying mortgage collateral pools divides prepayment risks (and, in other cases, default risks) of pool into tranches with low risk and tranches with high risk. 

The higher‐risk tranches have extreme sensitivity to unexpected changes in prepayment rates (and, in some cases, default rates).

The analysis and modeling of prepayment risks and default risks become more crucial in the case of highly structured products.

In the case of insured residential mortgages, the exposure of each tranche to prepayment risk depends on seniority of that tranche. 

The most senior tranches are certain to mature quickly, regardless of prepayment rates. 

The tranches with lowest seniority for receiving principal payments have maturities extremely sensitive to prepayment rates. 

If interest rates increase, then prepayments by homeowners are likely to fall.

- Longevity Characteristics of CMO Tranches

Fluctuations in interest rates and other factors that drive mortgage prepayments cause extension risk.

Extension risk is dispersion in economic outcomes caused by uncertainty in longevity (i.e. increased longevity) of cash flow streams.

E.g. when interest rates rise, prepayment rates fall, and life of most tranches (junior tranches) is extended, thereby increasing or extending expected life of tranche further than originally expected. 

In most CMO tranches, extension lowers the value. 
Some tranches can benefit from extension. 

These types of tranches fall in value due to contraction when anticipated longevity declines.

Contraction risk is dispersion in economic outcomes caused by uncertainty in longevity, especially decreased longevity, of cash flow streams.

- Estimating Cash Flows through a CMO Structure

Consider CMO with underlying collateral pool of mortgages generating R1,620,000 of cash flow in first month (after fees): R1,500,000 in interest fees (9% annualized) and R120,000 in principal repayments. 
A stylized sequential‐pay two‐tranche CMO structure is presented.
Payments are made first to Tranche A and then to Tranche B.

=>

In month 1, both Tranche A and Tranche B receive corresponding interest payments of R1,062,500 (R150,000,000 × 8.5%/12) for Tranche A and R437,500 (R50,000,000 × 10.5%/12) for Tranche B, for total of R1,500,000 in interest payments. 

The interest payments received equal interest payments owed to two tranches, and there's no residual tranche. 

The remaining cash flow of R120,000 is principal repayment received from underlying collateral, and is used only to pay principal to Tranche A. 

The reason is its sequential‐pay two‐tranche CMO, where principal payments are made to Tranche A until principal of Tranche A is fully paid off, after which payments are made to Tranche B. 

At end of month 1, principal balance for Tranche A is reduced to R149,880,000 (R150,000,000 – R120,000), and principal balance of Tranche B remains at initial R50,000,000, since Tranche B received no principal payment.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=5cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/5.4.2 Im92.png"}
\end{center}

In the case of Tranche A, interest payments due in second month decline because total principal is decreasing with each principal repayment. 

Tranche A is entitled to interest payments of only R1,061,650 (R149,880,000 principal at 8.5%/12 interest).

The principal for Tranche B will start to be paid off only after principal for Tranche A is fully paid. 

If prepayment rates of mortgages underlying CMO increase, Tranche A is paid off faster and Tranche B would start to be amortized earlier.

Conversely, if unscheduled principal repayments slow, anticipated longevity of Tranche A will extend, but only modestly, as scheduled principal payments continue (i.e. extension risk would likely be minimal). 

The anticipated term of Tranche B could extend substantially. 
In this simplified example, Tranche B continue until last underlying mortgage made its final payment, and depending on prevailing rates and anticipated reinvestment opportunities, would likely be positively exposed to extension risk.

In actual CMO structures, there's an accrual tranche, or Z‐bond, that receives no promised interest or coupon payments.

The tranche serves as residual, equity‐like claimant, with rights to cash flows that remain after all fixed‐income tranches are satisfied.

- Other CMO Structures and Tranches

Numerous variations are structured within a CMO issue other than sequential‐pay structure.

There is an evolution that occurs in structured products wherein simply structured products, if successful, evolve into increasingly complex and sophisticated products.

There are several more popular types of CMOs:

  i) Planned Amortization Class (PAC) Tranches - receive principal payments in a more complex manner than sequential pay CMOs.
  Investors in some PAC tranches have high priority for receiving principal payments as long as prepayment rates are within a prespecified range (planned prepayment levels). 
  When prepayments diverge from what was originally projected, relative priorities of tranches shift. 
  In sequential‐pay structure, the relation between tranche longevity and prepayment rates is somewhat linear, meaning each tranche’s longevity to changes in prepayment speeds is somewhat stable at various levels of prepayment.
  But with PAC tranches, its possible a tranche will contract in longevity as prepayment rates accelerate to certain point but then extend in longevity beyond that point.
  A tranche might have high priority to receiving principal payments in one range of prepayment speed and low priority if other prepayment speeds occur. 
  PAC tranches are riskier and more complex to analyze.
  
  ii) Targeted Amortization Class (TAC) Tranches - receive principal payments in manner similar to PAC tranches but with an even narrower and more complex set of ranges. 
  The amortization procedures identify narrower ranges of prepayment speeds within which tranches have particular priorities for receiving principal payments and interest. 
  These prepayment ranges are viewed more as targeted outcomes than as planned outcomes.
  TAC tranches are complex and risky. 
  A sensitive TAC tranche can switch from being quickly paid off to receiving no principal payments (and vice versa), even when prepayment speeds change by only a small amount.
  
  iii) Principal‐Only (PO) Tranches and Interest‐Only (IO) Tranches - PO tranches receive only principal payments from collateral pool, whereas IO tranches receive only interest payments from collateral pool.
  Both tranches are created by dividing cash flows from mortgage collateral into the portion, i.e. principal repayment and portion that's interest. 
  Principal repayment cash flows are distributed to one bond, the PO, and the interest cash flows are distributed to a second bond, the IO.
  Investors in PO bonds are ultimately paid the face value of their bonds as borrowers eventually make principal payments on their mortgages. 
  The logic behind PO is investors buy these bonds at discount from face value and receive face value through scheduled principal repayments and prepayments received from mortgages. 
  PO tranches are positively exposed to extension risk as their values decline when prepayments slow, since they receive no coupons.
  An IO bond has notional principal used to compute each interest payment.
  The cash flows received by investors in IOs decline as principal is paid down. 
  IO tranches are positively exposed to contraction risk as their values decline when prepayments accelerate, since their payments are only interest because notional principal is not repaid.
  Prepayment sensitivity is severe for POs and IOs, with one profiting when other suffers.
  For POs on fixed‐rate mortgages, when interest rates decline, the speed of prepayments accelerates.
  This contraction in longevity reduces life of both IO and PO. 
  PO tranches benefit from quicker receipt of their only cash flows: principal repayments in fixed amount of PO’s face value. 
  IO tranches suffer from principal reductions, since their only cash flows (interest payments) are proportionately reduced.
  When interest rates increase, the speed of prepayments declines, and PO investor is paid face value further in future, lowering its effective return, while IO receives longer annuity of interest payments. 
  Both tranches are issued with adjustable‐ and fixed‐rate underlying mortgages.
  
  iv) Floating‐Rate Tranches - earn interest rates linked to interest rate index, such as SOFR, and are used to finance collateral pools of adjustable‐rate mortgages.
  A collateral pool of adjustable‐rate mortgages provides a stream of variable interest rate payments that flow through to floating‐rate tranches, which also have floating coupons. 
  Floating‐rate tranches are structured to have rates that move more than underlying index or in opposite direction, which is an inverse floater tranche. 
  An inverse floater tranche offers a coupon that increases when interest rates fall and decreases when interest rates rise. 
  Floating‐rate tranches have specified upper and lower limits to their adjustable coupons.

- Motivations of Structured Mortgage Products

Mortgages offer up to 30 years of coupons and principal payments, with high uncertainty regarding level of unscheduled prepayments. 

Some investors prefer to take slices from this maturity range rather than invest in entire range.

Tranches permit investors to select securities that match their preferred exposures in terms of longevity and sensitivity to unscheduled prepayments.

These preferences are driven by two primary motivations: risk and return. 

Investors can lower their risk by selecting tranches with durations that match duration of their liability stream. 

Cash flow matching is one of many risk‐reducing strategies that is facilitated by structuring of claims.

Some investors have market view of future interest rates or prepayment speeds. 

An investor can select tranches of CMOs that offer enhanced returns to extent the investor’s market view is superior.

The overall role being served by CMOs is completion of market. 
CMOs create numerous otherwise unavailable investment opportunities (i.e. tranches) from a pool of previously existing collateral. 

When the structuring is formulated in response to market demand, the enhanced set of opportunities facilitates improved portfolios from perspective of market participants.

\end{center}

- Valuing Default‐Free CMOs

Prepayment decisions are made by property owners based on idiosyncratic events to homeowners and macroeconomic factors.

The effect of prepayment speeds on the valuation of CMO tranches is more critical than effects on overall mortgage pools. 

The reason is that structuring creates tranches with varying risks.

Suppose overall mortgage values drop by 1% due to increased interest rates. 

Whereas collateral pools tend to drop by 1%, the losses to various tranches vary based on sensitivity of each tranche to interest rates.

Long‐term, highly sensitive tranches drop by 5% or more, while very short‐term tranches are virtually unaffected.

Some tranches, such as IO tranches, might even gain in value.
TAC, IO, and PO tranches are sensitive to interest rates and prepayment speeds.

Valuation of tranches requires careful and sophisticated analysis using advanced models of interest rates and prepayment speeds.

The complexity of many CMOs creates both opportunities and threats. 

The sophistication of models used to evaluate tranches creates potential for analysts with superior skills to locate tranches of CMOs that are mispriced. 

The complexity of products and models also carries danger that analysts with inferior skills is induced into consistently making trading decisions that generate negative net present values. 

Highly complex tranches with innovative characteristics appear attractively priced when actually overpriced; thus importance of due diligence cannot be overstated.

- Systemic Risk and the History of Structured Mortgage Products

Interest rates rose dramatically, causing most CMO tranches to extend in maturity as prepayment rates fell. 

The combination of extended maturities and higher interest rates caused market values of most tranches to fall.

As investors and institutions suffered large losses, market liquidity eroded, and CMO tranches began to trade at prices reflecting more conservative prepayment rate forecasts, further exacerbating the crisis.

The worst case involved inverse‐floating TAC tranches.
Some tranches offered high coupons and were expected to mature within months, due to high prepayment rates in underlying mortgage pool and low interest rates.

These high‐coupon and short‐term tranches traded at premium prices to their principal values and appeared to have little risk exposure to small or moderate interest rate changes. 

As part of TAC structure, the tranches experience dramatic shifts in seniority to principal payments if prepayment rates deviated from target ranges.

Prepayment speeds dropped such that anticipated maturities of TAC tranches extended from several months to many years, and switched from being most senior to least senior tranches. 

In the case of inverse floaters, the coupons on tranches fell from high coupons to zero coupons as interest rates skyrocketed.

The result was some of tranches, previously viewed by market participants as having very low risk, fell from trading at premiums to trading at as little as 20% of face value.

This incredible drop in value occurred on tranche securities even though there was never a doubt the principal value of tranche would ultimately be recovered, since underlying mortgage pool was insured by U.S. government agencies. 

Many institutions suffered huge losses, some firms collapsed, and crisis widened until interest rates reversed their climb.

The prevalence and power of structuring of mortgage products is cited as causing or exacerbating both financial crisis of 1994 and 2008. 

In the most recent financial crisis, the financial losses in mortgage‐backed structured products centered on default risk.

In both cases, structured products contributed to increased systemic risk, substantially harming or even bankrupting major financial institutions and increasing uncertainty throughout financial markets.

Despite past problems with structured mortgage products, the power of structured products generated tremendous benefits. 

The long maturity and substantial prepayment risk of insured residential mortgages make unstructured ownership of mortgages undesirable to most market participants.

Mortgages offer cash flows that range in maturity from 1 to 360 months and offer uncertainty as to the size of each cash flow due to prepayment options held by borrowers.

Relatively few market participants find mortgages attractive direct investments because of their range of scheduled cash flows and exposure to prepayment rates and interest rates.

Structured mortgage products allow market participants to select longevities and risk exposures that more closely align with their preferences. 

Shorter‐term fixed‐income money managers purchase short‐term senior tranches, and longer‐term managers focus on longer‐term tranches of insured mortgages. 

The emergence of structured mortgage products in past several decades coincides with substantially reduced mortgage rate spreads, suggesting structured products have enabled hundreds of millions of homeowners to enjoy substantially lower financing costs.

- Commercial CMOs and Default Risk

For CMOs with underlying portfolios of commercial mortgages or subprime residential mortgages, the primary risk is default risk. 

In CMO structures with substantial default risk, the primary result of structuring of cash flows is to vary the level of exposure of each tranche to default risk. 

The most senior tranches have first right to scheduled and unscheduled principal payments and are last to bear losses from defaults. 

Conversely, more junior tranches are highly subject to default losses from underlying mortgage portfolio. 

The exposure of most CMO tranches to default risk is indicated by credit ratings assigned to each tranche.

Credit ratings differ considerably between different tranches of commercial mortgage‐backed security (CMBS) because each tranche has different risk profiles, maturities, and subordination.

Due to their subordination, more junior tranches have lower credit ratings. 

Conversely, senior tranches are rated AAA because they have high‐priority claim on cash flows and enjoy extra security embedded by having initial default losses absorbed by junior tranches.

The most junior tranches, referred as first‐loss tranches, are rated at non‐investment‐grade levels.

This dispersion in credit risk exposure and credit ratings has advantage of broadening pool of appropriate investors. 

The senior, investment‐grade‐rated tranches are viewed as fixed‐income securities, since they have limited expected exposure to default risk and are primarily analyzed in context of interest rate risk.

In contrast, the most junior tranches are viewed and analyzed as risky securities substantially influenced by risks of underlying real estate rather than being influenced primarily by interest rate risks.

Even a single large default can have considerable impact on performance of these junior securities.

In the case of CMBSs, junior tranches have higher coupons than senior tranches in same structure. 

Particular attention is placed on credit quality and other risk characteristics of underlying mortgage pool, which is collateral for structure.

Default‐risk CMO models focus on expected rates of default, correlation between defaults, and losses on each defaulted issue. 

The idea is to forecast probabilities of various cash flow streams from underlying mortgage pool and project likelihood of payoffs to each tranches.

### Introduction to Collateralized Debt Obligations

A collateralized debt obligation (CDO) applies concept of structuring to cash flows from portfolio of debt securities into multiple claims; these claims are securities and referred as tranches.

In practice, traditional operating corporations and other applications of structuring are financed with numerous classes of securities. 

Major corporations have multiple types of debt (accounts payable, short‐term credit facilities, senior bonds, junior bonds) or preferred stock. 

Some corporations have multiple types of equity, which differ in terms of voting rights or liquidity. 

The concept of multiple security types extends beyond traditional operating firm to such applications as multiple commercial mortgages on single property, multiple types of securities as sources of capital for closed‐end funds, and multiple bond issues for various levels of government.

The use of structuring to create multiple security types in alternative investing centers on CDOs. 

In its simplest form, a CDO is a collection or portfolio of assets financed with multiple securities (or tranches) that differ in regard to their seniority. 

- A Stylized CDO

The below is concept of CDO being used to structure cash flows and default risk from portfolio of high‐yield bonds.

There are R100 million of high‐yield bonds that serve as assets or collateral portfolio (or pool) for structure.

These bonds generate cash flows in form of coupon payments and principal payments.

The bond portfolio generate losses from events such as defaults in bonds and from profits or losses from trading activity. 

On RHS are various classes of securities (or tranches) that provided financing for portfolio and that have claims of varying seniorities to receive cash inflows.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=5cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/5.4.3 Im94.png"}
\end{center}

The cash flows from collateral pool of assets are distributed using a waterfall approach analogous to that for limited partnerships. 

Without any defaults, the assets generate R7 million in coupon income, found as product of asset size (R100 million) and average coupon of assets (7%). 

The first priority of cash flows is to meet direct expenses and fees for operation and management of CDO. 

After expenses and fees, the cash flows are distributed to various tranches in order of their seniority.

The senior tranche is tranche with first or highest priority to cash flows in structured product. 
The senior tranche is owed the first R2.1 million per year in coupon income, i.e. product of its size (R70 million) and coupon rate (3%).

A mezzanine tranche is tranche with moderate priority to cash flows in structured product and with lower priority than senior tranche.
The mezzanine tranche is owed R1.2 million per year after senior tranche is paid. 

The equity tranche has lowest priority and serves as residual claimant. 
The equity tranche has claim to remaining R3.7 million.

- Default Risk and CDO Cash Flows

This CDO contains bonds subject to substantial credit risk, since they are below investment grade (i.e. rated BB or lower), and its reasonable to expect defaults. 

When collateral assets default, the order of waterfall reverses relative to order for receiving cash flows, such that lowest seniority tranches experience losses first. 

The losses from asset defaults are posted against lowest remaining tranche until that tranche is wiped out, at which point the losses are posted against next lowest seniority tranche. 

Defaults in CDO’s collateral portfolio reduce both left and right sides of above picture. 
The assets are reduced in size and in annual income. 

The aggregated tranches are reduced in size by reducing tranches, starting with lowest‐seniority tranche.

As debt tranches are reduced in notional principal, their claim to coupon income is reduced. 

- Attachment Points, Detachment Points, Calls, and Puts

The first percentage loss in collateral pool that begins to cause reduction in tranche is the lower attachment point, or attachment point. 

The higher percentage loss point at which given tranche is completely wiped out is upper attachment point, or detachment point. 

Each tranche is identified using these points, such that mezzanine tranche in example is described as being a 10%/30% mezzanine tranche.

The risks and payoffs to most senior and most junior tranches in CDO is viewed using positions in either a call or a put. 

Similarly, structural credit risk model expressed positions of equity holders and debt holders in traditional capital structure of operating firm as synonymous with call options or put options.

The senior debt tranche is viewed in structural model as either covered call or riskless bond with a short put position on assets. 

Similarly, equity tranche is viewed in structural model as either a long position in a call option or a financed long position in assets with a long put position.
