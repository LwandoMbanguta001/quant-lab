# Topic 2: Introduction to Alternative Investments

## SubTopic 2.2: Environment of Alternative Investments

### Participants

Can be divided into four major categories:

#### 1) Buy Side

##### 

Refers to the institutions and entities that buy large quantities of securities for the portfolios they manage.

It contrasts with the sell side, which focuses on distributing securities to the public.

##### Institutional Allocators

- Plan sponsors

A designated party, such as a company or an employer, that establishes a health care or retirement plan (pension) for employees that has special legal or taxation status.

Are companies or other collectives that establish the health care and retirement plans for the benefit of the organization's employees or members.

These funds can be designed as defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. 

In defined contribution plans, employees take the investment risk, while that risk is borne by the employer in defined benefit plans. 

Defined benefit plans are more commonly associated with investing in and allocating to alternative investments.

- Foundations and endowments

A foundation is a not‐for‐profit organization that donates funds and support to other organizations for its own charitable purposes. 

An endowment is a fund bestowed on an individual or institution to be used by that entity for specific purposes and with principal preservation in mind.

- Family office and private wealth

Are private management advisory firms that serve ultra‐high‐net‐worth investors. 

A family office is a group of investors joined by familial or other ties who manage their personal investments as a single entity, hiring professionals to manage money for members of the office.

- Sovereign wealth funds

Are state‐owned investment funds held for the purpose of future generations and/or to stabilize the state currency.

These funds may emanate from budgetary and trade surpluses, perhaps through exportation of natural resources and raw materials.

Are accumulated to help provide financial stability and future opportunities for citizens and governments.

##### Investment Management Structures

- Private limited partnerships

Are a form of business organization that potentially offers the benefit of limited liability to the organization's limited partners but not to its general partner.

For tax purposes, limited partnerships tend to flow taxable revenue and expenses directly through to their partners rather than being taxed at the partnership level.

- Private investment pools

Focus on serving as intermediaries between investors and alternative investments.

Limited partnerships are usually managed by the general partner, while most of the invested funds are provided by the limited partners.

- Separately managed accounts (SMAs)

Are individual investment accounts offered by a brokerage firm and managed by independent investment management firms.

The relationship between an investment adviser and a client to whom advice is provided is typically documented by a written investment management agreement.

A customer pays a fee to a money manager for managing the customer's investment (similar to pooled investment arrangements), but different in the following ways:

i) A fund investor owns shares of a company that in turn owns other investments, whereas an SMA investor actually owns the invested assets as the owner on record.

ii) A fund invests for the common purposes of multiple investors, whereas an SMA may have objectives tailored to suit the specific needs of its only investor.

iii) A fund is often opaque to its investors to promote confidentiality; an SMA offers transparency to its investor.

iv) Whereas the fund structure may allow investors to have limited liability, the SMA format may allow losses to be greater than the capital contribution when leverage or derivatives are used.

- Mutual funds (’40 Act funds)

Are registered investment pools offering their shareholders pro rata claims on the fund's portfolio of assets.

- UCITS (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities)

Allow retail access and marketing of hedge‐fund‐like investment pools.

- Master limited partnerships (MLPs)

Are publicly traded investment pools that are structured as limited partnerships and that offer their owners pro rata claims.

MLP units are traded on major stock exchanges, but have legal and tax structures similar to those of private limited partnerships.

#### 2) Sell Side

#####

Make their research available to their clients and are more focused on facilitating transactions than on managing money.

- Large dealer banks

Are major financial institutions that deal in securities and derivatives.

Act as intermediaries in the markets for securities, repurchase agreements, securities lending, and over‐the‐counter (OTC) derivatives.

Are often engaged in proprietary trading.

Have large asset management divisions that cater to the investment management needs of institutional and wealthy individual clients.

Operate internal hedge funds and take on private equity partnerships as part of their business management service.

The bank acts as a general partner with limited‐partner clients.

The role of dealer banks in the primary market is to intermediate between issuers and investors, to provide liquidity, and to act as underwriters of investments. 

In secondary securities markets, large dealer banks trade with one another and with brokers/dealers directly over the computer or the phone, as well as play an intermediating role of facilitating trades.

Also engage in proprietary trading.

Proprietary trading occurs when a firm trades securities with its own money in order to make a profit.

Serve as counterparties to OTC derivatives such as options, forwards, and swaps that require the participation of a counterparty dealer who meets customer demand by taking the opposite side of a desired position.

Are active as prime brokers that offer professional services specifically to hedge funds and other large institutional customers.

Have ventured into off‐balance‐sheet financing methods, a practice that involves a form of accounting in which large expenditures are kept off the company's balance sheet through various classification methods. 

Companies use off‐balance‐sheet financing to keep their debt‐to‐equity and leverage ratios low.

They share many of the same responsibilities as conventional commercial banks, including deposit taking and lending to corporations and consumers.

- Brokers

Receive commissions for executing transactions and have research departments that make investment recommendations.

Advantages of using brokers include their expertise in the trading process, their access to other traders and exchanges, and their ability to facilitate clearance and settlement.

Traders can use broker services when they want to remain anonymous to other traders.

Traders can manage their order exposure by breaking up large trades and distributing them to different brokers or by asking a single broker in charge of the entire trade to expose only parts of the order, so that the full size remains unknown to other traders.

The brokerage firm's proprietary trading operations involve the firm's own account, called the house account. 

Other sources of broker revenue include soft commissions, payments for order flow, interest on margin loans, short interest rebates (on short sales), underwriting fees when the firm helps clients sell securities, and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) fees. 

The major cost of running a brokerage firm is labour.

Brokerage firms and other firms with major investment activities organize their activities into three major operations: 

i) Front office operations involve investment decision‐making and contact with clients.

ii) Back office operations play a supportive role in the maintenance of accounts and information systems used to transmit important market and trader information in all trading transactions, as well as in the clearance and settlement of the trades.

iii) Middle office operations form the interface between the front office and the back office, with a focus on risk management.

#### 3) Outside Service Providers

#####

Alternative investment funds rely on outside service providers for their successful creation and operation.

- Prime brokers

Allow an investment manager to carry out trades in multiple financial instruments at multiple broker‐dealers while keeping all cash and securities at a single firm.

Have primary functions: clearing and financing trades for clients, providing research, arranging financing, borrowing and lending securities, and producing portfolio accounting

Have a powerful tool in their ability to make margin calls.

Can demand that the fund manager deposit more cash into its prime brokerage account to support its leveraged trading, and that the fund manager liquidate outstanding portfolio positions to raise cash to deposit with the prime broker.

The ultimate threat is that the prime broker can seize collateral from the hedge fund manager and liquidate the collateral to raise cash.

- Accountants and auditors

The accounting firm providing services to a hedge fund/another alternative investment fund should include an experienced auditor and tax adviser. 

During the creation of the fund or investment vehicle, the accounting firm provides services largely parallel to those of an attorney: reviewing legal documents to ensure that accounting methods and allocations are appropriate and feasible, and that relevant tax issues have been addressed. 

The accountant helps prepare partnership returns and the necessary forms for the investors in the fund to report their shares of partnership income, deductions, gains, and losses.

The adviser also provides tax‐related advice to the fund throughout the year and may be called on as a consultant on structuring and compensation issues for the principals of the general partner. 

The auditor performs a year‐end audit of the fund, including the review of security pricing, and presents the results of this audit to the fund and its investors.

- Attorneys

Helps determine the best legal structure for a fund's unique investment strategies, objectives, and desired investors. 

Takes care of filing any documents required by the government and creates the legal documents necessary for establishing and managing a hedge fund or another alternative investment. 

Can offer guidance on marketing a hedge fund or another alternative investment in full compliance with all legal requirements, as well as on operational issues, such as personal trading.

- Fund administrators

Responsible for bookkeeping, third‐party information gathering, and securities valuation functions for all of their funds, both onshore and offshore.

Has ten roles:

i) maintains a general ledger account

ii) marks the fund's books

iii) maintains its records

iv) carries out monthly accounting

v) supplies its monthly P&L statements and calculates its returns

vi) verifies asset existence

vii) independently calculates fees

viii) provides an unbiased, third‐party resource for price confirmation on security positions

ix) produces a monthly capital account statement for investors, and

x) apportions fund income or loss among them

Takes over the duties of day‐to‐day accounting and bookkeeping so that managers can focus on maximizing the portfolio's returns.

- Hedge fund infrastructure

May have three main financial components:

i) Financial platforms are systems that provide access to financial markets, portfolio management systems, accounting and reporting systems, and risk management systems.

ii) Financial software may consist of prepackaged software programs and computer languages tailored to the needs of financial organizations. 
Some funds use open‐source software, and others pay licensing fees for proprietary software.

iii) Financial data providers supply funds primarily with raw financial market data, including security prices, trading information, indices, and company‐specific information such as income statements and balance sheets. 

Due to legal implications, directly marketing alternative investment vehicles can be problematic. 

One method of indirectly marketing private funds is to report a fund's performance to an index provider, especially if the fund's performance is attractive. 

Index providers compile indices of prices that assist fund managers in evaluating performance.

- Consultants

May be hired by allocators to provide a number of roles and services that center on advice, analysis, and investment recommendations.

Offer unbiased analysis of money managers’ investment performance, as well as advice on how to best allocate funds.

Used to serve the role of chief investment officer in small organizations.

The role of an outsourced chief investment officer (OCIO) ranges from performing all of the decision‐making duties of an in‐house chief investment officer to a reduced role of assisting staff with a subset of decisions.

Are compensated for their services in one or more of the following ways: 

i) fees from their clients

ii) fees from proprietary investment products, or 

iii) compensation packages from the money managers for whom they generate business.

Conflicts of interest can emerge when consultants are compensated by money managers because this form of payment can detract from the ability to offer independent advice to clients and encourage the consultant to favor the money managers offering compensation.

Compensation that consultants receive from money managers is undisclosed and can be quite substantial.

Some consultants waive their regular consulting fee, giving the impression that their services are free.

A third compensation approach has emerged in which consultants use their expertise in manager selection and risk management to serve as fund‐of‐funds managers to their clients.

This arrangement avoids explicit fees to the investors for the consulting advice, and offers the potential that the consultants will act with substantial objectivity in the selection of managers.

- Depositories and custodians

Are very similar entities that are responsible for holding their clients’ cash and securities and settling clients’ trades, both of which maintain the integrity of clients’ assets while ensuring that trades are settled quickly.

The Depository Trust Company (DTC) is the principal holding body of securities for traders all over the world and is part of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), which provides clearing, settlement, and information services.

- Banks

Commercial bank focuses on the business of accepting deposits and making loans, with modest investment‐related services.

Investment bank focuses on providing sophisticated investment services, including underwriting and raising capital, brokerage services, mergers, and acquisitions.

Hedge funds may enlist the services of a commercial bank to facilitate the flow of both investment‐ and non‐investment‐related capital. 

Hedge funds may also use their commercial bank for loans, credit enhancement, and/or lines of credit.

#### 4) Regulator

#####

Privately organized investment vehicles generally receive reduced regulatory scrutiny because the participants involved tend to be sophisticated institutions or individuals perceived to be less in need of regulatory protection than the general public.

These regulations may be insufficient in protecting the financial markets and/or economy from catastrophic risks, described as systemic (or systematic) risk.

Systemic risk is the potential for economy‐wide losses attributable to failures or concerns over potential failures in financial markets, financial institutions, or major participants.

Given the complexity, opaqueness, use of leverage, and multitude of other factors, the participants in the alternative investments universe have the potential of contributing to systemic risk factors.

### Alternative Investment Legal Structures

There are numerous legal structures used throughout investments to meet the preferences and needs of investors and managers.

- Limited Liability and Passive Investments

Limited liability is the restriction of potential loss to a fixed sum.

Receiving this protection in most jurisdictions requires that the investor or manager not be actively engaged in control of the firm's operations.

The issue of liability is therefore related to whether or not the investment is passive.

In the context of investment strategies, passive investments can refer to buy‐and‐hold strategies often designed to match the risk and return of an index.

In the context of limiting liability, passive investments are positions in entities over which the owner of the position does not exert substantial control and therefore may receive reduced liability exposures and/or passive investment tax treatments. 

Limited liability raises concerns over probity in the management of enterprises when investors and managers with limited liability are in the asymmetric position of having huge potential profits and limited losses. 

Probity is the quality of exercising strong principles such as honesty, decency, and integrity. 

- Corporations and Limited Liability Companies

A corporation is a legal entity in which its shareholders receive distributions on a pro rata or pari passu basis and which generally provides limited liability for passive investors.

A limited liability company (LLC) is a distinct entity:

i) Designed to offer its investors protection from losses exceeding their investments absent fraud/other activities that could “pierce the veil” between the member's ownership interest in the LLC and the member's other holdings, and

ii) Does not require distributions and any other advantages of ownership be made in proportion to each member's capital contribution to the firm.

An LLC may be structured to make distributions to members with or without consideration of ownership percentages.

Alternative investments, investors and managers use LLCs and other entities offering limited liability to serve as a buffer to reduce liability exposures.

Entities are created and used for various purposes such as shielding assets, reducing taxation, simplifying regulation, and avoiding entanglements in proceedings such as bankruptcy.

- Limited Partnership Structures

The General Partner (GP) organizes the fund and manages the assets. 

The limited partners contribute most of the capital.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=3.5cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/2.2.2 Im1.png"}
\end{center}

The general partners likely formed an LLC (“parent LLC”) that in turn formed an LLC to serve as the general partner and another LLC to serve as the investment adviser to the partnership.

The personnel involved in three LLCs may be overlapping or even identical, with the primary functions of preserving liability and providing clarity with regard to control.

Each PE fund is managed by a general partner. 

The general partner is typically the PE firm that raised the capital for the fund. 

The general partner sources investment opportunities for the fund, reviews business plans, performs due diligence, and, once an investment is made, takes a seat on the board of directors of the start‐up company and works with the management of the company to develop and implement the business plan.

\begin{center}

\end{center}

At the base of the diagram is the underlying PE investment, which consists of the private business enterprises from which all cash flows to investors must ultimately be derived.

The middle level represents PE funds, which are investment pools created to hold portfolios of PE securities (i.e. equity securities at the bottom).

The funds serve as intermediaries between the underlying business enterprises (called portfolio companies when they are owned by a fund) and the investors in the PE funds.

Institutional investors typically invest in PE as LPs in these funds rather than through direct ownership of PE securities. 

These PE funds are also often referred to as PE investments.

Limited partnership funds (indicated PE funds), are also referred to as PE investments.

- Bankruptcy‐Remote Entities

Is structured as a special purpose vehicle or entity.

A special purpose vehicle (SPV) or special purpose entity (SPE) is a legal entity such as an LLC that serves a specific function (such as holding assets), often with the goal of being bankruptcy remote. 

A bankruptcy‐remote entity is designed to provide protection from involvement in potential bankruptcy proceedings of the entities placing assets in the vehicle.

- Entities Facilitating Investor Taxation Differences

Master‐feeder funds are designed to provide efficient access to investors who are subject to different taxation but wish to invest in the same portfolio.

Offshore jurisdictions typically do not charge taxes on investment income in the country of the fund's domicile, but trust that investors will pay taxes on the investment income in their home country.

Offshore vehicles are designed to be efficient tax‐neutral investments vehicles appropriate for asset owners with a wide array of home countries and tax regimes.

The master fund/master trust is the legal structure (typically offshore) used to invest the assets of both onshore investors and offshore investors in a consistent, if not identical manner, so that both types of investors can share the manager's skills. 

Investors access the master fund through feeder funds.

A feeder fund is a legal structure through which investors with common preferences with regard to taxation can have efficient access to the investment performance of the master trust.

Together, the master trust and feeder funds are referred to as a master‐feeder structure.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=5cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/2.2.2 Im3.png"}
\end{center}

The purpose of the master fund is tax neutrality, not evasion.

For example, in Bermuda, master trust funds pay only a corporate licensing fee, not corporate income tax to ensure that there are no tax consequences to the fund investors at the master trust level.

### Key Features of Fund Structures

- Key Partnership Documents

Key documents used in establishing and managing a hedge fund, private equity fund, or other private partnership: 

i) private‐placement memoranda (or offering memorandum)

Include the formal description of an investment opportunity that complies with securities regulations.

ii) (limited) partnership agreement

A formal written contract creating a partnership.

iii) subscription agreement

An application submitted by an investor who desires to join a limited partnership.

iv) management company operating agreement

An agreement between members related to a limited liability company and the conduct of its business as it pertains to the law.

Limited partnership agreement (LPA) defines its legal framework and its terms and conditions.

Private equity managers are not fiduciaries, so limited partners should not assume that the general partner has the best interest of their investors in mind.

The LPA has two main categories of clauses: 

i) investor protection clauses - cover investment strategy, including possible investment restrictions, key‐person provisions, termination and divorce, the investment committee, the LP advisory committee, exclusivity, and conflicts.

ii) economic terms clauses -  include management fees and expenses, the GP's contribution, and the distribution of cash (i.e. the waterfall)

Distribution waterfall defines how returns are split between the LP and GP and how fees are calculated. 

LPAs are continuously evolving, given the increasing sophistication of fund managers and investors, new regulations, and changing economic environments. 

The LPA lays out conditions aimed at both aligning the interests of fund managers with their investors and discouraging the GP from cheating (moral hazard), lying (adverse selection), or engaging in opportunism (holdup problem) in whatever form. 

Moral hazard and adverse selection take place when there is asymmetric information between two parties.

Adverse selection takes place before a transaction is completed, when the decisions made by one party cause less desirable parties to be attracted to the transaction.

Moral hazard takes place after a transaction is completed and can be defined as the changes in behavior of one or more parties as a result of incentives that come into play once a contract is in effect. 

In economics, the holdup problem is a situation in which two parties refrain from cooperating due to concerns that they might give the other party increased bargaining power and thereby reduce their own profits.

- Corporate Governance in Private Funds
