# Topic 5: Private Debt

## SubTopic 5.1: Private Credit and Cash Based Strategies

### Private Credit Strategies

Four primary types of debt are: leveraged loans, direct lending, mezzanine debt, and distressed debt.

Some analysts believe the global financial crisis and subsequent regulations led directly to the growth of private credit market.

During the global financial crisis of 2008, there were a number of bank bailouts, leading to increased regulations, such as the Basel III framework in Europe.

These new regulations require banks to comply with stress tests and capital adequacy requirements, making banks more accountable for the types of loans they make and for types of risks they take.

As these regulations took effect, European banks reduced their balance sheets, leading to five years of a decline in the amount of lending by banks to small and medium enterprises.

If small companies aren’t allowed to access bank credit, they need to have access to alternative lending or marketplace financing in order to run their firms, hedge funds, private equity funds, and private credit funds stepped in to make these loans.

Over $200 billion of private debt investments are held in dry powder.

The level of dry powder is impactful on the opportunity set for private credit investors.

An oversupply of dry powder reduce credit spreads and weaken covenant protections. 
An undersupply of dry powder could not be enough private credit available if theres a surge of buyout and merger activity, combined with a continued need for borrowings at small and medium enterprises.

Because of illiquid nature of private credit, theres a limited opportunity to access these investments through funds containing mostly liquid assets such as open‐end mutual funds.

Private credit investments are made predominately through private equity-style funds, however some strategies (i.e. distressed debt) are suitable for vehicles such as hedge funds. 

Business development companies (BDCs) are a public market vehicle that partakes in private credit strategies.

One of the downsides to investing in publicly traded BDCs is they are subject to wide swings in their premium or discount to net asset value.

BDCs exhibit high price volatility, especially compared to other vehicles evaluated using monthly NAVs.

- Funds with a Loan‐to‐Own Objective

Some private credit strategies underwrite debt with a loan‐to‐own objective. 

A loan‐to‐own investment occurs when investor focuses on the value of the borrower’s assets and the value of the company could be repossessed if the borrower was unable to service the loan, not necessarily evaluating the ability of company to pay back principal and interest as scheduled. 

The lenders may prefer the company default in order for the loan to turn into an ownership stake in the firm or its assets.

- Fulcrum Securities and Reorganization

A private credit firm may seek to invest in a fulcrum security.

A fulcrum security is the senior‐most debt security in a reorganization process that is not paid in full with cash but rather is the security most likely to be repaid with equity in the reorganized firm. 

Some of the largest gains in private credit investing occur from converting a debt security into equity security. 

The equity in the newly reorganized firm is substantially undervalued during its first year, for several reasons. 

Many investors may not be legally allowed to hold equity recovered in the reorganization process.

As such, they'd quickly sell the equity holdings, which initially depress the stock price. 

Outside investors are slow to warm up to the new stock, as they're focused on negative headlines of recently completed bankruptcy process, and perhaps underestimate the reduced risk and increased cash flow of the firm that just reduced or eliminated its liabilities.

After a few quarterly reports as a new company, the lower‐risk and higher‐return nature of the stock reveals itself, leading to enhanced profits for long‐term investor in fulcrum security that morphed into highly successful stock holding.

While a private credit fund has a longer‐term investment in the debt or equity of the firm, hedge funds have a shorter‐term trading‐oriented view, where they profit in the role of a liquidity provider. 

- Private Credit Performance

As with any investment, investors are concerned with how private credit and distressed investments will alter risk and return of their portfolio. 

Its imperative to understand how the asset allocation will change when new investments are made in alternative credit vehicles.

i) reported valuations of mezzanine, distressed, and direct‐lending strategies excluding mezzanine exhibit relatively low price volatility.
This perception is due to smoothing effects of a lack of liquidity on valuations of these strategies, where either the loans were not regularly traded or were held to maturity by originator of loan. 
Thus adjust for smoothing of illiquidity using autocorrelation techniques.

ii) there were relatively high correlations between distressed debt, BDCs, high‐yield bonds, and leveraged loans. 
In contrast, direct lending strategies ex‐mezzanine had lower correlations.

iii) mezzanine, leveraged loan, and high‐yield investments had lower levels of return. 
Distressed and direct‐lending ex‐mezzanine investments had higher returns.

While it appears that mezzanine, direct‐lending ex‐mezzanine, and distressed funds have lower risk, its not accurate to compare volatility and correlation of returns of these less liquid investments to the seemingly higher volatility and correlation of returns of high‐yield, BDC, and leveraged loan strategies. 

It appears that over the given time period (including global financial crisis), distressed and direct lending strategies, the most complex and illiquid investments in this sector, exhibit sustained outperformance relative to more liquid fixed‐income strategies.

In alternative credit strategies, it appears illiquid strategies performed well. 

Investors who avoided being forced sellers and had cash to buy at bottom of last credit cycle profited from this strategy, especially if they had expertise to work through bankruptcy process and hold equity assets at the end of restructuring process. 

Hedge funds with shorter holding periods and less willingness to work through restructuring process may be able to profit simply by buying from forced sellers such as pensions and insurance companies subject to regulations that prohibit the holding of distressed paper, open‐end funds that have significant investor redemptions, and investors with too much leverage who are forced by a counterparty to quickly reduce their degree of leverage. 

Each scenario has led investors to sell more than half of their illiquid fixed income holdings in less than a month.

History shows its much better to be a buyer than a seller at the bottom of a fire sale.

### Credit Risk Analysis and the Bankruptcy Process

- An Overview of Credit Risk

Credit risk is dispersion in financial outcomes associated with failure or potential failure of a counterparty to fulfill its financial obligations. 

In contrast to equity‐related risk, which have symmetrical payoff distributions, credit risk leads to payoff distributions skewed to the left.

The upside performance of a traditional position exposed to credit risk is limited to the recovery of the original investment plus the promised yield, whereas the downside performance lead to loss of entire investment.

Default risk is the risk the issuer of a bond or debtor on a loan will not repay the interest and principal payments of outstanding debt in full.

A debtor is in default when it fails to make a scheduled payment on its outstanding obligations.

Default risk can be complete, in that no amount of bond or loan will be repaid, or can be partial, in that some portion of original debt will be recovered.

Credit risk is influenced by both macroeconomic events and company‐specific events.

Credit risk can be affected by a liquidity crisis when investors seek the haven of liquid U.S. government securities. 

Idiosyncratic or company‐specific events are unrelated to the business cycle and affect a single company at a time. 

These events are due to a deteriorating client base, an obsolete business plan, noncompetitive products, outstanding litigation, fraud, or any other reason that shrinks the revenues, assets, and earnings of a particular company.

As a company's credit quality deteriorates, a larger credit risk premium is demanded to compensate investors for the risk of default. 

The non–U.S. Treasury fixed‐income market is referred as the spread product market, because all other U.S.‐dollar‐denominated fixed‐income products trade at a credit spread relative to U.S. Treasury securities. 

Similarly, risky debt denominated in other currencies trades at a credit spread over the bonds of dominant sovereign issuer in that currency.

- Credit Risk Analysis and the Bankruptcy Process

Because much of private credit market is below investment grade, its imperative investors understand how to value these loans, as well as the work necessary to recover and protect assets in the case of a bankruptcy filing.

Investment grade investors are primarily concerned about interest rate risk and prepayment rates, below-investment grade investors face substantial default risk related to credit risk of the borrower as well as price risk of underlying collateral.

Default risk is related to covenants and recourse.

Covenants are promises made by borrower to lender, such as requirements that borrower maintain the property in good repair and continue to meet specified financial conditions. 

Failure to meet covenants can trigger default and make the full loan amount due immediately.

The view that covenants benefit lenders at expense of borrowers is naïve. 

Although covenants lower the credit risk to lender, they are offered by borrower in exchange for better terms on the loan (lower interest rate). 

Borrowers choose to offer particular covenants by selecting lenders that demand those covenants, because they prefer lower rates of loans attached to those covenants.

Commercial loans contain more detail concerning seniority of the loan. 

If the loan is senior or original debt (first lien or first mortgage), the lender has to provide permission before subsequent debts can be incurred.

Another key element in any debt deal is the recourse the lender has to borrowing entity. 

Recourse is the set of rights or means an entity such as lender has to protect its investment. 

Recourse include how the loan is secured and potential ability of lender to pursue recovery from borrower's other assets.

 In order to mitigate the risk they are exposed, lenders use a cross‐collateral provision, wherein the collateral for one loan is used as collateral for another loan.
 
- Financial Ratios and Default Risk

The Loan-To-Value (LTV) ratio, both at origination of loan and on ongoing basis, is a key measure used by lenders. 

Lenders also examine a variety of income‐based measures, in addition to LTV ratio, when assessing credit risk of loan. 

Lenders also examine interest coverage ratio, which is defined as company’s EBITDA divided by loan's interest payments. 

The interest coverage ratio allows lenders to analyze the level of protection they have in a borrower's ability to service a debt from company’s income. 

A related measure is debt service coverage ratio (DSCR), which is ratio of company’s EBITDA to all loan payments.

Another key ratio with a broader definition of expenses is the fixed charges ratio. 
The fixed charges ratio is the ratio of company’s EBITDA to all fixed charges that borrower pays annually.

- Credit Ratings, Yields, and Financial Ratios

Moody’s, S&P, Fitch, and other rating agencies are paid by borrowers to assign ratings to bond issues and large loans. 

Investors rely on these ratings to understand the credit risk of issues and to assign credit spreads to loans and bonds.

Debt rated as investment‐grade is expected to have very low default rates, and lower credit spreads. 

Most transactions in private credit market, especially smaller loans with a single lender, are not rated by credit ratings agencies.

Investors estimate ratings are assigned by a rating agency by studying the balance sheet and income statement of borrower. 

Once investors understand the credit risk, they assign a credit spread to the unrated debt. 

As the debt gets more risky and more likely to default, the implied credit rating declines and the interest rate charged to the borrower increases.

Most borrowers in private credit market are unrated, but implied credit rating methodology would classify many of borrowers as having a credit rating of B.

Ratings agencies consider a number of variables when rating credit quality of a borrower. 

Less‐risky borrowers have higher profit margins, higher assets, lower debt, and lower interest expense. 

Businesses with lower revenue volatility and lower profit volatility are regarded as less likely to default. 

The relations between ratings, credit risk, and two key financial ratios (interest coverage and leverage) are:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=5cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/5.1.2 Im74.png"}
\end{center}

Private credit investments have wider credit spreads than found using this implied credit rating method, as the illiquidity of investment and value added to the borrower are greater than found in public bond market.

- Credit Spreads and Credit Risk

One of the ways to analyze the fixed‐income market is by size of credit spread observed on a given debt issue, ranging from safer investment‐grade debt to riskier noninvestment‐grade debt.

A credit spread is excess of yield on a debt security with credit risk relative to yield on a debt security of similar maturity but no credit risk.

An investment‐grade credit spread is amount of yield on investment‐grade debt security relative to sovereign debt with comparable maturity demanded for investing in firms that have modest default risk.

As investors move from sovereign debt or risk‐free level of interest rates into investment grade, they take on additional amount of credit risk for which investors require compensation.

The investment‐grade market has low interest rates because these issues have a low probability of default, as the debt is backed by a larger number of assets and dependable cash flows compared to the debt load of the firm.

There's a difference between yields of investment‐grade debt and non-investment‐grade debt.
Non-investment‐grade debt is also termed high‐yield, speculative, or junk bonds. 

A company with lesser assets or lesser cash flows or greater volatility of financial results is determined to be a speculative‐grade issuer, thus would pay higher interest rates required of below‐investment‐grade issuers.

Firms in high‐yield or speculative‐grade category are charged higher borrowing costs, as they have a significantly higher probability of default, thus might not pay their principal and interest as scheduled.

Sometimes the defaults are not driven by failure to pay principal and interest, but rather by failure to maintain covenants that require the company to maintain a given level of cash flows or assets.

It’s hard to estimate a yield curve for long‐term high‐yield debt, because investors and borrowers may not want to contract for 30 years when the borrower (company) has a highly questionable ability to repay that loan due to concerns by lenders of high risk and concerns by borrowers of high costs. 

High‐yield bonds are issued with much shorter maturities.
High‐yield issuers don’t have same ability to make coupon and principal payments as sovereign issuer, which justifies the higher interest rate sought by investors to compensate for increased credit risk, as losses from defaults offset part of higher interest rate.

- Credit Risk and the Probability of Default

A relatively low spread of 100 bps between sovereign debt and investment‐grade issuers is explained by relatively minimal defaults on investment‐grade issues.

This is safest type of corporate debt, because when business cycle is getting rough, default rates on investment‐grade debt don’t reach 1%. 

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=5cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/5.1.2 Im75.png"}
\end{center}

Default rates vary with economy: default rate is very low for a long period of time when economy is strong and very high during times of economic or financial crisis. 

- Covenants

Covenants are promises made by debtor to creditor that strengthen the perceived credit quality of obligation. 

Loan covenants are required by creditors to protect their interests, or are offered by debtors to negotiate better terms.

The types of bond covenants affect credit risk. 
Covenant‐lite loans are loans that place minimal restrictions on debtor in terms of loan covenants.

As the strength of covenants declines, the likely default rates rise and likely recovery rates decline. 

An indenture is the contract between borrower and lender that sets out the terms of borrowing. 

These terms include interest rate, maturity date, face value, and schedule of payments, as well as covenants.

Affirmative covenants are requirements for borrower to comply with, such as to maintain a debt service coverage ratio that requires a minimum income relative to size of current year principal and interest payments. 

Investors require the cash flow of company be at least twice what the firm owes in current‐year debt payments, giving a cushion for the borrower to service their debt payments and reinvest in their business. 

Under these affirmative covenants, the firm must disclose their financial results to prove compliance with covenants, such as the need to maintain a given level of assets relative to their debt burden or specific level of cash flow or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) relative to their annual interest expense.

Negative covenants, or prohibitions on actions of borrower, prevent the company from increasing their debt load or issuing any new debt with seniority to the current first‐lien debt issues.

When a borrower fails to maintain either affirmative or negative covenants, they are in technical default on the loan. 

Upon that default, creditors step in and take action to accelerate the loan by requiring immediate repayment, restructure the loan at higher borrowing cost, move to seize collateral, or force borrower into bankruptcy proceedings.

Covenants are in bond indenture in order to protect lenders and/or lower borrowing cost of borrower. 

Covenants increase security of loan, requiring the company to meet certain financial targets and submit to oversight by lender. 

As investment capital continues to flow into increasingly competitive private credit market, there is an increasing amount of covenant‐light issuance in both high‐yield bond market and private debt market, transferring the balance of power toward borrowers.

Another distinction between covenants is incurrence covenants versus maintenance covenants.
Incurrence covenants require a borrower to take or not take a specific action once a specified event occurs. 

E.g if incurrence covenant states the borrower maintain a limit on total debt of five times EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), the borrower can take more debt only as long as its still within this constraint. 

A borrower that breaches this covenant by incurring additional debt is in default of covenant and loan.

However, if borrower found itself above five times EBITDA limit because its earnings and cash flow deteriorated (without having incurred additional debt), it'd not be in violation of incurrence covenant and would not be in default. 

Cov‐lite loans have bond‐like incurrence covenants, like high‐yield bonds.

Maintenance covenants are stricter than incurrence covenants, they require a standard be regularly met to avoid default. 

Returning to previous example, the borrower must pass this test each and every quarter, regardless of whether it added more debt or its earnings and cash flow deteriorated. 

The covenant would be triggered if borrower’s earnings and cash flows eroded, even if the firm did not issue new debt.

Maintenance covenants are much stronger than incurrence covenants. 
Without maintenance covenants, lenders do not have ability to step in at an early stage to reprice risk, restructure the loan, or shore up collateral provisions.

- Five Ways Covenants Can Control Risk

1) Preservation of collateral - Because the value of collateral is key to both the quality of loan and eventual recovery rate upon distress, lenders control risk by limiting the size of loan relative to value of firm and value of collateral. 
Senior secured loans be of limited size, perhaps half of enterprise value of firm. 
Each asset is pledged as collateral to a single lender.

2) Appropriation of excess cash flow - Lenders are protected when uses of corporate cash are limited.
Many lenders require majority or entirety of value of asset sales and new debt be paid to debt holders rather than to equity holders.
Increasing the debt load while liquidating assets reduces value of firm, so paying proceeds from those transactions to equity holders reduces the security of the debt and increases risk of debt.

3) Control of business risk - There's an inherent conflict between stockholders and bondholders. 
When the company prospers, equity holders experience large gains, whereas lenders earn principal and interest as contracted. 
When the company becomes distressed, bondholders have downside risk larger than upside return potential.
Stockholders are long call option on firm’s assets and bondholders are short put option on the assets. 
This conflict leads to equity holders wishing to undertake risky projects when firm is approaching distress, because upside risk benefits equity holders and hurts bondholders. 
Its in the best interest of lenders to limit types and sizes of investments, mergers, and debt the firm can undertake.

4) Performance requirements - Under negative covenants, the company must maintain strong ratios of assets and cash flow relative to debt and interest burden of firm.
Capital expenditures need to be limited in order to maintain compliance with requested financial ratios.

5) Reporting requirements - Under affirmative covenants, the company needs to report financial results to lenders, including other material information regarding projections of revenues and expenses, litigation, and regulatory issues.

- Capital Structure and Priority

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm, height=5cm]{"C:/Catapult Programme/Training/CAIA/Images/5.1.2 Im76.png"}
\end{center}

Loans and secured borrowings have highest credit quality, highest claim or priority to assets in the case of bankruptcy, and lowest potential return.

Next in line come bonds and unsecured debt with lower recovery rates and higher potential returns. 

Junior, mezzanine, subordinated, and convertible debt sit in the middle of capital structure. 

These are debts of firm, but each has lesser claim to cash flows and assets than seen in senior secured and first‐lien debt. 

These issues in the middle of capital structure are riskier than senior debt and have a higher interest rate.

The amount of risk an investor takes is commensurate with yield the investor is going to earn. 

As one invests in riskier and riskier parts of a given company, one should have a higher level of return expectations.

Equity and preferred issues sit at bottom of capital stack. These investors have lowest claim on assets of distressed firm, but highest potential return on investment when firm performs well.

The capital structure of firm can change over time, such as debt‐equity swap, where proceeds of debt issue are paid to equity holders through dividends or stock buybacks. 

Increasing borrowing and repurchasing stock changes the capital structure of firm and increases debt‐to‐equity ratio.

Senior debt issues had lower interest rates and a higher place in capital stack.

If borrowers needed to access more debt capital than allowed in senior debt market, they'd need to turn to subordinated debt market to access that extra debt capital at much higher interest rate.

There is substantial growth in unitranche debt market, in which a large piece of debt is issued that includes both senior and junior debt at a blended interest rate in a single debt issue. 

The unitranche structure could bring benefits for both borrowers and lenders. 

Borrowers have a less complex capital structure and willing to pay a higher interest rate on a unitranche borrowing for convenience. 

Lenders prefer a less complex capital structure, because it avoids conflicts between creditors and makes workouts easier, as lender of junior debt is also lender of senior debt. 

Unitranche debt has become popular that it appears that mezzanine lending is declining due to rise of direct lending and unitranche structures.

- Recovery Rates

When a firm defaults, they cannot pay principal and interest as scheduled or firm fail to comply with one or more of their covenants, in that their cash flow or asset value drops to a point where it appears they’re not able to service the debt. 

Recovery rate is portion of face value of debt thats paid back from assets of firm in a bankruptcy. 

In a liquidation bankruptcy, the lenders or court have decided this company is no longer a going concern. 

The business model of the company is not likely to earn cash flows sufficient to pay back the debt, even if that debt has been restructured. 

In a liquidation bankruptcy, the assets of firm are distributed to creditors or sold with proceeds being distributed.

Firms are in default because their assets and cash flows are not sufficient to pay liabilities of firm.

A reorganization bankruptcy makes sense for a good company with a bad balance sheet. 

If liabilities can be reduced or reorganized, the company could be profitable.

If the firm had less debt, it'd be able to be profitable going forward.

In a reorganization bankruptcy, the firm can renegotiate any and all liabilities, such as union contracts, leases, pensions, and debt issues. 

With the assistance of the court, the borrower renegotiates all liabilities and seeks to change contracts in a way that allows the firm to continue its operations in a profitable manner.

First‐lien term loans or secured bonds have highest recovery rate, as those debt issues sit at top of capital structure as safest investments likely recover majority of value of assets in bankruptcy. 

Subordinated debt or junior debt have lower recovery rates. 
In a reorganization, senior debt holders take a haircut, or reduction in amount owed, accepting new debt with face value of 70% to 80% of old debt, which is haircut of 20% to 30% of face value. 

Subordinated debt is cancelled and converted into equity stake in newly reorganized firm, which is a going concern where ongoing cash flows of firm are no longer encumbered by legacy liabilities.

At bottom of capital stack, equity holders before bankruptcy lose their entire investment in liquidation or reorganization bankruptcy because the firm is in default and doesn’t have assets or cash flow to pay their senior and junior debt in full. 

If assets and cash flow are insufficient to pay senior debt and junior debt, there are no assets left over for equity holders. 

Equity is riskiest part of company’s capital structure, where stockholders expect to make highest return also experience largest losses. 

In a reorganization or liquidation bankruptcy, equity holders earn a zero recovery or experience a 100% loss of their capital.

### Bonds and Loans

Much of investment capital allocated to private credit and distressed debt is invested in unrated debt or debt rated as below investment grade.

- Three Key Differences between Bonds and Loans

Investment banks underwrite bond issues and sell bonds to external investors.

Borrowers receive capital today, and lenders receive annuity of coupons and a return of face value at maturity. 

Loans are privately traded debt instruments underwritten by a bank. 
After the bank has made the loan, it can either retain that loan on its balance sheet or sell it to other investors.

Syndicated loans involve multiple lenders for a single borrower, which gives borrowers access to larger loans.

Loans are private placements not subject to same regulatory oversight as securities issued in public bond market, and are less liquid than publicly traded bonds.

Corporate bonds and loans have several key differences from investment perspective:

  i) Liquidity - Bonds are publicly traded debt securities with high liquidity, which leads to bonds offering higher prices and lower yields compared to other instruments in private loan market. 
  Some investors are attracted to loans, as they earn an illiquidity premium that'd increase the yield above that of bond with similar credit quality and features.
  
  ii) Default risk - Loans are the most senior debt instrument in capital structure and secured by significant collateral. 
  Bonds are more junior in capital structure relative to loans and are unsecured, having higher recovery rates.
  
  iii) Interest rate risk - Most bonds are fixed‐rate, i.e. coupon rate set when bond is issued will not change during life of bond.
  Most bonds are non‐callable, at least for some time period, so borrower cannot immediately refinance or repay principal on bonds before maturity or call date. 
  Many loans are callable, meaning they can be prepaid at any time without prepayment penalties. 
  Loans are likely to have floating rates, so interest rate on loan increases when market level of interest rates rises. 
  This means bonds have higher interest rate risk.

- Leveraged Loan Basics

Leveraged loans are syndicated bank loans to non‐investment‐grade borrowers.
Syndicated refers to use of a group of entities, in underwriting a security offering or jointly engaging in other financial activities. 

Loans made to corporations can be divided into two general classes: 

  1) those made to companies with investment‐grade credit ratings (BBB or Baa and above), and 
  
  2) those made to companies with non‐investment‐grade credit ratings (BB or Ba and lower). 
  This second class of loans refers to leveraged loans.
